    "reviews": "I would give the service 10 stars if I could!  Eli took great care of us, and was so super friendly it made our experience amazing!  The food was really good, and the atmosphere was great, lots of TVs for sports viewing, good music on in the background.  We got burgers and they were yummy, but we have to come back for the milkshakes.  We will be back, and I highly recommend! This place was very good, id recommend it for any occasion other than fancy things. Food was good and service was fast enough and friendly.  Only problems is it was cold in the room, the tots are a little greasy and the server took my girlfriends tots before she was done. Otherwise great experience.  Would come here again. First time and definitely not the last time. Excellent visit tonight. The smashburgers are spot on and the fresh cut fries are great. Everything was delicious. Had a margarita and it was very good, too. Quick and friendly service. We will definitely be back! Great food. I got the Magic Mushroom burger and the fried pickles as an appetizer. The mushrooms on the burger were perfect. They are thin and caramelized to perfection. Also, I asked for a medium rare cook on the burger and they actually gave me a perfectly medium rare burger which is so hard to find at burger joints! The pickles were thin, crispy and super yummy. They also came with ranch which was a great perk. The service and atmosphere were so fun, clean and comfortable. Totally recommend. Thursday house margs for $4?! What a steal. Amber was absolutely incredible. We had mozzarella medallions, fried pickles and house margaritas."

    "reviews": "Hacienda Real is a wonderful , authentic Mexican restaurant .  The food is exceptional and deliciously fresh.  Large menu and the service is excellent! The chicken mole enchiladas are fantastic, the mole is the best.  The Colorado chili is also great.  The tequila chicken salad is fresh and has excellent flavor! I would highly recommend this place for lunch or dinner. I love the decor, colorful and comfortable.  And the waiters are super friendly! the chips were hot & the salsa was great! my enchiladas were fantastic, beans & rice also good. the margarita was also good, and the sopapillas were SO DELICIOUS. honestly the best part was the impeccable service. definitely coming back!!! We found the cutest little very authentic Mexican restaurant last night for Cinco de Mayo! It\u2019s so yummy and respectable pricing! Delicious and highly recommend the Mexican pizza (seafood)! We got to draw a paper with a discount or something from them. I ended up getting a homemade tequila shot for free. Since there were two of us they brought 2. It was also delicious and smooth! We will be back there for sure! Hacienda is a 5 star restaurant all the way! Delicious food, excellent service and a nice atmosphere. We have had takeout food here a couple of times but our most recent time was the Saturday after Thanksgiving. We popped in and asked if we could have a drink while we waited for our to-go meal to be prepared. They don\u2019t have a bar but the server graciously let us take a table and even offered us chips and salsa. We took our meals home and they were so flavorful! I had the asada steak burrito which was smoothered and my husband had the #27 which was a pork burrito and a fried chili relleno (this dish has multiple options). We recommend Hacienda to anyone looking for delicious Mexican food! This place is small and sorta a hole in the wall but immediately you are greeted with great service. Their margaritas are awesome and a great price. Salsa is very unique and flavorful. Carne Asada plate is one of the best I\u2019ve ever had. My kids love the chopped chicken breast with fries. Servers always treat us special and deliver a great meal."

    "reviews": "I can\u2019t say enough good things about my experience at Modern Market! I came in about 30 minutes before closing and was blown away by the incredible service from Steven. Even though it was my first time there, he took the time to ask thoughtful questions and guide me through the menu, making sure I got exactly what I wanted. His kindness, enthusiasm, and attention to detail went far beyond my expectations. It\u2019s rare to find someone who truly cares about the customer experience like he does, and it left a lasting impression. Thanks to Steven, Modern Market has earned a loyal customer\u2014I\u2019ll definitely be back! Mind you - the food was phenomenal. Steven, thank you!! On the way out of the South West Plaza mall, in Littleton Colorado, we stopped in to get some takeout. As always the food is amazing. Quick service clean eats at its best! I get the lemongrass Tuna bowl, and I LOVE the chili vinegar on it. The cashier was new, and had a few challenges with finding the extras I asked for, and a very patient co-worker helped her through it with kindness and grace. I NOTICED! Later, when collecting my tasty nosh, I asked this kind person for yet another extra, and found out he was the new GM of Mod Market! All I can say is, in a world where customer service is rare, THANK YOU Mod Market for getting it right, hiring Steven as your new GM. Your food and Your staff ROCK! Keep up the great work! Nice lunch box.\n\nReal chunks of beef with tasty red cabbage and dressing in the beef bbq sandwich. Look at the size of beef, chucks not thin slides.\n\nGood salad and GF Chocolate cookie to top it off  great lu ch box They offer a lot of gluten options, which are marked on the menu. I got the Blackened Chicken Mango bowl, which was very good. I don't find it particularly blackened, but it was really good. I used to love this restaurant but the portions have been reduced to the point of absurdity and the cost has gone up in reverse proportion.  This salad was not edible and it only had 3 measly slices of chicken breast and about a 1 tbsp of dressing.  Even if they had filled up the dressing container it still would not have been enough to hide the lack of taste.  My chicken bacon sandwich was not much better with two tiny pieces of bacon and basically no flavor and it cost (16.99)  I will probably not be back. Don't get ripped off like I did."

    "reviews": "Stopped in for a late lunch early dinner. Ordered their garlic steak. The steak plate was served hot and sizzling. Everything was nicely flavored. Had the artichoke dip and chips for an appetizer. The dip was good and the chips were crispy. The 2 for $25 deal is great bc it comes with a choice of an appetizer or you can get 2 side salads with your 2 entrees. The service was good and friendly. Good the food was served quick and hot. They have great specials on cocktails and alcoholic beverages. My strawberry lemonade was served in a big cup. There\u2019s a bar you can sit at and eat. Or you can choose to sit at tables and booths. There are plenty of TVs to view. The ambiance and decor of the restaurant is very casual with lots of windows and natural light. The bathroom was clean. The place is nice, but my experience was ruined by one thing: they assumed a tip of over 22% without asking me. When I paid my $21.58 bill with $30, they just handed me $3.50 back without even asking how much I wanted to leave as a tip.\n\nIt's not about the money; it's about the principle. Tipping should be the customer's choice, not something the staff decides for you. This kind of assumption is disrespectful and uncomfortable, and it undermines trust in their service. One  our favorite places to go out to eat are:    The two for twenty-six deal is excellent.    The  ribs let\u2019s can\u2019t be beat.     My wife really likes the oriental chicken salad. We both like the boneless buffulao chicken wings.    I love the riblets  the honey barbaque sauce is very good.  They are a bit messy but worth it  . The only thing I don\u2019t like as a diabetic is their lack of modern sweeteners.   No Splenda and no Stevia.     Sweet and low  just doesn\u2019t cut it Just a great place for a cocktail and a meal. Good food, great service. You might say I'm a salad diva. I like a salad the way I like it, typically requiring modifications from the menu. Well, they nailed it!! For me, that's a five star.\nAdditionally, the hubby's lettuce wrap was good, the waitress was very nice, she got my order correct and it was just a very good experience."

    "reviews": "Ordered delivery , dry stale wings the chicken is so hard and dry like it\u2019s old af I paid $50 for something I could\u2019ve got better at king soopers for half the price. I\u2019m so disappointed today fries are like not even edible. Do better. Order 8BC07 - GROSS!! Bre was fantastic at Buffalo Wild Wings, making our 10-year draft party in the back room even more special with her attentive service. Big thanks to management for letting us book the room and to the kitchen for their hard work! I would like to share my experience because honestly this is really unacceptable. I went today to change my rewards because I had 7,000 points and I always buy a lot of wings in this place and I redeemed 30 wings and guess what? They give me    reheated wings. Bad experience never going to that place again. If they don\u2019t want a give a good service they shouldn\u2019t have mobile apps and giving you \u201crewards \u201d. Here is picture of how it looks an it taste tough.. I recently had the pleasure of dining at Buffalo Wild Wings, and I can\u2019t say enough about the exceptional service provided by our server, Bre. From the moment we sat down, Bre\u2019s energy and warmth made us feel like we were the only table in the place. Their genuine smile and enthusiasm for the menu instantly set the tone for a fantastic experience.\n\nBre was incredibly attentive, striking the perfect balance between being present and giving us space to enjoy our meal. They took the time to explain the sauce options, offered spot-on recommendations (the honey BBQ wings were a game-changer!), and even checked in to make sure our drinks were topped off without us having to ask. What stood out most was Bre\u2019s ability to handle a busy section with ease\u2014never once did we feel rushed or overlooked.\n\nBeyond their professionalism, Bre brought a personal touch that made the visit memorable. They cracked a few lighthearted jokes that had our whole table laughing and shared a quick story about their favorite game-day moments, which perfectly matched the lively vibe of the restaurant. It\u2019s clear Bre loves what they do, and that passion shines through in every interaction.\n\nIf you\u2019re heading to Buffalo Wild Wings, ask for Bre\u2014you\u2019re in for a treat. They\u2019re the kind of server who turns a good meal into a great experience. Five stars all the way! Recieved just a glaze at the bottom of the container for my southwest sauce, barely covers the bottom of the container. And they were nice enough to open the ranch in the bag for me before I could get to it. I know its busy for the Broncos game and I didn't mind waiting an hour for my food, but you could have at least been nicer with my sauces."

Delivery from Bonefish Grill is very small portions and missing most of the food. Nothing I ordered matches any pictures on the menu this is a scam Spectacular dining experience. Our excellent server had the finest customer service. Glasses, bald and beard guy (sorry forgot your name brother!) Deserves the finest tips.\n\nFood was unforgettable. Delectable.\n\nWill always come here for the Chimicurri. As always Bang Bang Shrimp for my wife and she loves it.\n\nThanks!\n\nBest wishes from your friendly local reviewer!\n\nChris L. Ate for the first time at Bonefish Grill in Colorado Springs. We loved the delicious food. We had the plank salmon based on our servers recommendation with the Coconut Rum Cake for dessert. It was sooo tasty. Our server was gracious,  knowledgeable of the menu, and definitely the hardest working employee there. He waited tables, ran the bar, and was very personal with all the guests. The atmosphere was relaxing, and everything, including the restrooms were very clean. I would definitely recommend this location to one & all. Great restaurant with a wide selection of surf and turf options. All the food is great- I recommend the wood fired trout, and the servers are super attentive and friendly. I would call it classy vs. up scale, still mellow enough for your average diner. Great for a date night. Tim was our server and he was wonderful!  He was very patient when we waited for quite awhile for friends to come, but found that they wouldn\u2019t be coming due to illness. He was very kind and concerned.\n\nEmily was our server 2-3 times before tonight.  She was also an excellent server.  Very friendly and efficient.\n\nWould highly recommend this Bone Fish to anyone looking for great food and great service!"

    "reviews": "While the majority of the staff we encountered was pleasant, the food was a complete nightmare. Our meals, which included two chicken burritos and one steak burrito, tasted overwhelmingly like chemicals. It seemed like someone might have contaminated the beans\u2014either with cleaner or a dirty utensil.\n\nWe couldn\u2019t eat a single bite of our $48 order, which felt like a total waste. When I called Qdoba to report the issue, the response was underwhelming: \u201cOk, I\u2019ll tell someone.\u201d I even asked for a refund and was abruptly hung up on.\n\nThis experience was unacceptable; we won\u2019t be returning. The reason this is not a one-star is because this location offers breakfast. However, I must warn you that the breakfast burritos or rather pricey for the quantity you receive.\n\nNow for the negative parts - I've been having a problem with this location recently. For years I have gotten my kids a burrito and sometimes the kids want certain ingredients in the burrito and sometimes they do not. I have asked the team to make the burrito and put beans on the side and Chicken on the side because my kids share the larger burritos. My issue is that the people checking us out will often ring in the burrito as a chicken burrito and then charge for an extra side of chicken and a side of beans. All of a sudden the cost of that burrito doubles. Never before do they used to do this and I have been going to this location for almost 20 years.\n\nTheir excuse is that it messes with their inventory. I don't see how it messes with your inventory when this is something that is normally included but it's just placed on the side in my kids instance. When did they start closing the lobby early? I went at 9 pm and was informed that we had to take the food to go since they where cleaning lobby, it was now closed. The door says they close at 11 and so do their digital hours but there isn't anything about lobby hours. As well as the gentleman working was trying to sweep the dirt into a pile next to us as we where getting drinks. Please update your hours The service was rude and impatient.\nThe meat looks like it was sitting there for a little while.\nI just took my food home and had to reheat it, and I got an attitude when I asked for my sour cream and guac on this side as well for my Nacho bowl, but I want my chips and cheese on the side. But they said they couldn't do it. So I had to pay for chips and cheese and my bowl on the side. Some of the best Mexican food I\u2019ve ever had!  I especially liked the Nachos but everything was really good!  The restaurant was spotless and well-maintained, creating a great dining atmosphere. I\u2019d love to come back again for sure!"

I could understand if they didn't hear me when I order my Spicy Chicken sandwich with no Mayo, but how do put Mayo on the sandwich and still put the no Mayo sticker on the wrapper? \ud83e\udd14 Being busy isn't an excuse to steal from your customers because when someone pays for a triple and gets a single that's straight theft. Or you need to learn to read. And come to think of it you weren't really that busy. I am incredibly thankful for the staff at this Wendy's location who went above and beyond to help when my son faced a personal issue after our visit. Their kindness and the sincerity of the manager truly made a difference, and I deeply appreciate that personal touch in service.\n\nWhen it comes to dining, this is the only fast-food restaurant my kids ever ask to visit! As a mom, I love that they offer affordable menu options, and the food is always freshly made to order.\n\nThank you, Littleton Wendy's, for your exceptional service and delicious food! Showed up at 1:03am on a Friday night, with a car that just went through and was sitting at the pay window and was told they were closed. I mentioned 'oh so you closed early' and the some guy replied with oh we just close early when sales are where they should be...... um correct me if I'm wrong... but I'm a paying customer so giving sales... and they wouldn't help me even though someone just got to order and be helped. Terrible customer service and no wonder they don't even have 2 stars on yelp.... Food is always cold. I keep getting chicken wraps and the wrap is always cold. They have no respect for your food. They have no concern about your complaints. Horrible place to come get food. Might as well go to Burger King when it's fresh.\n\nDon't come here unless you want your food to be cold. Everybody here sucks. They dont know how to make your food fresh."

Pizza, salad, and cinnamon sticks were all truly phenomenal. Will absolutely be coming back - we have a new favorite dinner spot! 11/10! Belle was great! We came in on a mid-Sunday afternoon so we could avoid having to cook dinner. Belle was very helpful with the menu and gave us good suggestions on which size salad to order. Caesar was perfect for one person- Belle suggested both ranch and buffalo for our pizza crust which was perfect for dipping. Even better, the beer was ice cold on a hot afternoon! Ordered a classic pepperoni deep dish- Pizza was delicious and playlist was great. Can\u2019t believe Littleton/Lakewood finally has a great Detroit-style option that is this good! Will be returning! This restaurant is amazing! BEST Gluten Free \ud83d\ude0b pizza, bread sticks, artichoke dip!!! The staff was so nice and helpful. We drove over 60 miles to this location from northern Colorado to try the GF pizza and it WAS worth it. Good job! Coco was an amazing server! So nice, helpful and knowledgeable. The atmosphere was bright, clean and fun.  The pizza was fantastic... first time at VIA 313 and it was excellent. Highly recommend and we will be back. Oh ya, don't forget to try the garlic cheesy bread... fanominal! We\u2019d been looking forward to trying this location for a while, and it absolutely lived up to the hype. From the moment we walked in, the atmosphere was warm and welcoming, and the experience only got better from there.\n\nOur server, Grace, was outstanding\u2014friendly, attentive, and genuinely kind. She went above and beyond to make our family feel comfortable, even bringing out some pizza dough for our kids to play with, which they absolutely loved. It was such a thoughtful touch that made the evening extra special.\n\nThe food was just as impressive. The Detroit-style pizza was a standout\u2014perfectly crisp on the edges, loaded with flavor, and clearly made with care. And just when we thought the night couldn\u2019t get better, we were surprised with a plate of warm, cinnamon dessert sticks to finish things off on a sweet note.\n\nAll in all, this was one of the best dining experiences we\u2019ve had in a while. Great service, delicious food, and a family-friendly vibe that makes you want to come back. Highly recommend giving this place a try\u2014 you won\u2019t be disappointed!"

I sat immediately at the bar and I was greeted instantly and given a water and asked for a drink order. I ordered a martini and it was very good. I had the mushroom soup and the buffalo chicken salad. All of my food was amazing the soup especially! The staff was nice and prompt and after another gentleman asked how my experience was. The view here of the lake is really nice. I will be back \ud83d\udcaf We were recommended this place and we really enjoyed the atmosphere. We were told the chicken was good, and people with us enjoyed the chicken. Everything was good, but I left hoping for better for the prices.\nService was slower, but friendly.\nIt was winter, so we didn't check out the patio next to the small lake, but it looks like it would be nice in the Summer. I had a walled Eye Fish and chips. It was fresh and cooked well with balanced flavours. The restaurant overlooks the lake and outdoor seating is a must on good sunny days. I will definitely come back and highly recommended! First time trying The Lake House Kitchen & the whole family loved it!  Casual dining, good food & great service - had sat at the bar while waiting for our reservation (great idea) lots of TV's to watch the games and took our wait staff's recommendations - Chicken Piccatta - delicious!! Unfortunately we were there on a rainy day, but it looks like it has a beautiful outdoor seating area. Most the people in our party got clam chowder and raved about it. And several people got the walleye dinner and thought it was fabulous. We had a great time. We also had two grandchildren there and they had commentated them very nicely"

Every time I visit, I\u2019m blown away by the quality of the food, the friendliness of the staff, and the overall dining experience. The burgers are consistently cooked to perfection\u2014juicy, flavorful, and packed with fresh ingredients. Whether you go for a classic cheeseburger or one of their signature creations, you really can\u2019t go wrong. The variety on the menu is also impressive, with plenty of options for everyone, including chicken sandwiches, salads, and even vegetarian choices.\n\nOne of the highlights of dining here is the service. The staff is always welcoming, attentive, and quick to ensure you have everything you need. Whether it\u2019s refilling drinks, checking on your meal, or bringing out more fries, they truly go above and beyond. Speaking of fries, the bottomless steak fries are simply unbeatable! They\u2019re crispy, perfectly seasoned, and keep coming as long as you can eat them.\n\nThe atmosphere at this Red Robin is warm and inviting, making it a great spot for families, friends, or even a casual date night. If you\u2019re looking for delicious food, excellent service, and a fun dining experience, Red Robin in Littleton is the place to go! This is an awesome Red Robin restaurant. Great dining experience in a family friendly atmosphere. Our server was very attentive, always checking on us and very helpful. The best burgers and even pizza. Everything was fresh and tasty. Can't get enough Bottomless Fries or onion straws. 5/28/2025 early evening... ordered my go-to burger for take-out. I've had Red Robin many times in the past, but THIS time was an EXCEPTION! My burger was SOOO oily / greasy, the paper that wrapped the burger was SATURATED with oil / grease... the paper actually STUCK all over my burger necessitating picking little paper pieces OFF before consuming (I almost threw the whole thing in the trash, instead dried burger with a new paper towel... all I had to readily eat! Spoke to LYNN (mgr) who stood her ground & did NOT budge an inch for my COMPLAINT!!! We come quite frequently and we sit at the bar. we love Amanda and Lynn the manager who take great care of us. The food's always fantastic and quick. By the way, you can request crispy fries, which are awesome. We're really enjoying dining at Red Robin. We used to dine here occasionally but lately we've been dining here much more. The burgers are always great and you just can't beat bottomless fries. You can't go wrong with the recently added $9.99 Tavern burger, bottomless fries and drink. See you there!"

Don\u2019t recall the gentleman that greeted me at the door but he suggested a specific cocktail after we discussed what I had prior to arrival. Ended up having 3 and visiting with the very nice bartender Kyle. The place has a calming atmosphere with a variety type of seating arrangements. Would be a great location for a date, business interaction, or just solo. I didn\u2019t try the food as I wasn\u2019t hungry. I will definitely come back! Girlfriend and I finally had an opportunity to check this place out. And it did not disappoint. Very small but extremely cute bar/ lounge. Had a great atmosphere in there and the staff is absolutely amazing. We had someone coming over to our table what seemed like every 5 minutes?  The food is very minimal but what we had was a very good. Watch out for the prices if it's not happy hour. It is easy to drop some money in here. But again I really loved it and so did my girlfriend. I would definitely recommend it. The espresso martinis and the charcuterie board (packed with delicious meats, cheeses, and crackers) are absolutely fantastic! The service is stellar, making the experience even better. This spot is perfect for a quick date night with drinks and a tasty appetizers. Highly recommend! Cool speakeasy type atmosphere, drinks were reasonably priced and tasty, service was great. Charcuterie board was a little pricey, but had a great selection of meats and cheeses so felt reasonable. Overall great experience and would come back. Outside of the building looks plain, but the inside is nice. Came here for just one drink, will be coming back for many more drinks. I wasn\u2019t able to try the mixed drinks yet, but plan to soon. The atmosphere is so cozy, with couches and booths, as well as the bar. It\u2019s the perfect place to meet friends to chat and hang out. No ultra loud music, so you can hear the person next to you. Staff is amazingly friendly and helpful. They have a bunch of TVs, which may or may not be your thing but is helpful to know."

    "reviews": "I don't go here regularly since I've moved from the area, but sometimes stop on my way home from work on Friday. My boss turned me onto this place years ago. It has been consistently good. Up until now, super dry, like all the moisture was cooked out of the pizza. My boss has been telling me it hasn't been good for months, and I didn't believe him. It is confirmed I won't be dining here again, which is a shame. I may try the Baker one when it opens as it is close to my house, but that will be the last chance. I will say the wings were good as they usually are. Ya\u2019ll, come and give this place a try! The take-out orders were non-stop the entire time we were sitting there, so we knew it was going to be good. We ordered the Italian-style buffalo wings and the kicking bourbon wings, both were outstanding. The cheesy breadsticks were definitely top notch, but the marinara was average. The service was fast and friendly. We are DEFINITELY coming back to try the pizza. This may be our new go-to in the Littleton area. We've been to this place twice in the past month. The food was good enough the first time for us to come back a second time. On this visit, the food was good as we expected, and our server (young person/long curly hair) was very kind and attentive. But there is one girl who works the counter (short/glasses) who is downright rude. She looked disgusted with us when we walked in a month ago, and it was the same experience this time around. We ignored it, as we did the first time. As we were leaving, we overheard her say \"Wait! They didn't pay!\", when in fact, we did pay, tipped 25%, and we have our credit card receipt to prove it. We never leave reviews for places, because if we have a bad experience, we just won't go back. But this repeated judgmental attitude and assuming we didn't pay should be known to the powers that be, that this person in particular is why we will not be coming back, or any other location for that matter. Funny that an establishment that has the walls littered with concert posters are judgmental towards musicians. Guess that's what Denver has become. This was a horrible order I placed through door dash. Had only left a negative review for rotten salad pieces throughout my salad. I've reported to door dash. I should have waited because I also ordered the\n\n\"14\" Panama Not-So Red\nHerb Garlic Olive Oil, Artichokes, Portabella Mushrooms, Caramelized Onions, Feta Cheese, Mozzarella.\"\n\nI added extra Mozzarella, sausage, and white onions. What WAS MISSING are my two favorite ingredients! NO ARTICHOKES, and NO PORTABELLA MUSHROOMS! Very simply will not order here again. Amazing pies, some of the best pizza ever. Got take out for the whole family and when we picked it up, I highly recommend grabbing a pickle shot! Their wings were top notch as well - dry rubbed was the way to go."

    "reviews": "First time visiting this brew bar and was excited.  I was quickly greeted but the service ended there.  Quickly realized that if you are not a familiar face the service is non-existent.  Group of definitely obvious regulars at the end of the bar and the bar tender spent all their time with them.  The person next to me on the other side of the bar was also a regular by the way the bartender acknowledged him my name multiple times.  With a glass 1/4 full the bartender walked by two or three times to the person next to me and never asked for a new drink.  Very disappointed in how the attention was given to regulars.  If you choose to return for drinks and become a regular, good luck with any service. Fun place with lots of selection in beer. Staff is a hoot and the regulars are fun to talk to. They rotate their selection frequently and have plenty of games if you want to. Always love coming here. Super cute place!\n\nThe staff is absolutely amazing, they are always so calm cool and collective every time I show up. Nice and steady slow pace with a beautiful front row seat view of the city of Littleton downtown.\n\nThe atmosphere is very relaxing. I love that they\nhave a non-alcoholic beverage alternative. I would absolutely recommend Jake's Brew bar. Is JBB my new favorite bar?!? I think it is! HUGE variety of quality beers on tap and in bottle from around the country all housed in a retro space full of kitchy decor.  The crowd felt very local as well as it\u2019s right in the heart of downtown L-town, within walking distance of everything.  In addition to the cavernous front room, there\u2019s also a nice secluded patio out back that\u2019s gotta be \ud83d\udd25 during the summer. Jake's is my GO TO place for beer. Whenever I get to Denver, I always try and make it here. Their buyer has amazing taste & knowledge. I've seen beers and offerings here that I haven't seen anywhere else in Denver.\nThe staff has always been exceptional and actually know their beers as well.\n\nJake's is in old town Littleton. Great place & location. Highly recommend."

    "reviews": "Really enjoy this place. I've ordered  breakfast and brunch here. My meals have been delicious. The pecan syrup is liquid candy, so good, and the beignets go well with the jellies on the table. Cajun breakfast with potatoes and a side of gravy for the massive biscuit. Poached eggs were perfect, so were the red beans\nMust recommend the famous bloody Mary if you're having drinks. It was strong enough to be worth the price without being overpowering.\nService at the bar was quick and friendly even though the house was packed. Poor experience at this Lucile\u2019s location. Ordered two coffees and one cup came back with lipstick on the rim. That happens.\nThe big disappointment was the return cup. It had a roach floating in the coffee\u2026 see the photo.\nHopefully this isn\u2019t representative of food safety and health standards at this location.\nDo better. Recently visited Lucile's Creole Cafe and had a wonderful experience. We ordered the beignets, coffee, Eggs Jennifer, Eggs New Orleans, and Pain Perdu. Everything was absolutely delicious. The beignets were hot, light, and perfectly dusted with powdered sugar \u2013 a great start to the meal. The chicory coffee was rich and smooth, complementing the flavors of the dishes perfectly.\n\nThe Eggs Jennifer and Eggs New Orleans were both flavorful, with rich, savory ingredients that really captured the essence of Creole cuisine. The Pain Perdu was the perfect sweet treat to finish the meal, perfectly crispy on the outside and soft inside.\n\nAdditionally, the staff was incredibly pleasant, adding to the overall positive atmosphere of the cafe. I definitely plan on coming back to enjoy more of their delicious dishes. This place was full on a Sunday morning for brunch. I think the food was just a bit too heavy for my tastes and reflects my score. Beignets were large but not as good as the ones I had at Downtown Disney in California. The egg breakfast was ok - again just too heavy for me. The biscuits however were great."

    "reviews": "Met up with some friends who had relocated, so we had a larger party of  ten on a Sunday afternoon. Our table was lovely and in a semi open air area of the rooftop bar. Service was attentive, accutate, friendly and in one word...awesome! The food was delicious and exactly as described on the menu, which had many, many options. We spent 2 hours there enjoying well missed friendships and celebrating the opportunity to reconnect over a good meal and atmosphere. Really great margaritas and the queso is amazing. A fun location and the staff is very friendly. They have a great patio with 3 levels. It's a good atmosphere.  Food is bigger but a little expensive.  My favorite is the Pancharita is a great drink. Happy Hour is 2-6 p.m. The carnitas on fries appetizer was great! We had good service... the wait person checked in occasionally, but not so as to be interrupting the ambiance.  Quite a good local band on the outdoor patio. I should say patioS... plenty of deck space close to he band or far enough away to allow for good conversation. Inside there are many rooms with more or less 'privacy' and televisions tuned to sports. One of our group had a fantastic looking salad! Recommend!! This place is huge. I hadn't been there in many years & it has expanded, I'm pretty sure. The first thing I noticed at 5;00 on a Wednesday afternoon was that the near parking was full. But not a problem. There was plenty of convenient parking just a few steps farther away. There is a huge covered patio that is really nice. The Happy Hour crowd was having a fun time - it was really noisy. I had a burger & it was good. The service was friendly & efficient. I will go back more often now that I have \"rediscovered\" it."

    "reviews": "Stopped in for a quick drink and bite to eat. We ordered the patty melt to split. Once we halved it, we noticed the burger was TINY compared to a normal bread slice. The burger was half the size of the bread, so it was a lot of waste that we did not eat and hardly any onions. Also, it should have been on Rye, not white. The side was not decent, either. I wish I had gotten a picture. They were very shy on the portion of fries. Waited a longer time than normal to order and receive the food. Absolutely would not recommend and we will never be back again. Really awesome neighborhood bar. Really good wings and on Fridays a really good wing special. The green chile had good flavor but was more liquidy than I prefer... Will need to try it again on top of a burger. Great staff and great fries too We came for the avalanche game and loved it! Food\u2026 great! Service\u2026 out of this world. Amelia was the best. So freaking sweet but also just a perfect 10/10 server! Recommend this spot, for all the things but for sporting events it\u2019s the best! I LOVE this gem and I go everytime I visit! Food was amazing love the wings and sliders! Service is like no other, I live in Las Vegas and the service I receive here is better! Everyone is nice and on top of it even when it's packed! Great game room in the back with pool table, pinball golf and hunting!!! Do yourself a favor and stop in if you are in the area, grab a drink or bite to eat and enjoy! Staple of downtown Littleton,  great staff and owners, my wife and I are long-time friends now to all who contribute to this dive gem. Great food with an American and Mexican twist, cold beer, and popular spirits. It will get crowded during evening hours towards and during the weekend. TouchType for music and even has a couple arcade games and a decent pool table. Been going for about 5 years now \ud83d\udc4d"

Service was great! Five stars for that. Food is mid at best. There was a guy vaping right by us on the rooftop and the staff refused to do anything about it. Went for dinner upstairs for view/Setting.\nRewarded with excellent food and drink!\nExcellent service also. I had the absolutely best salad I have had here. The strawberry salad with dates,figs,feta,cherries, nuts on mixed greens with light strawberry dressing. I know I left something out sorry.\nI went back the very next day for a second one to make sure. Enjoy! Great restaurant with great food!! The staff are so friendly and welcoming too. It\u2019s always a fun time at ViewHouse. The jalape\u00f1o poppers are incredible, and the wings are amazing! Food and drinks were so good and the service was great too. Good place for our family.

    "reviews": "Very comfortable atmosphere. Very clean. Perfect lighting. The cocktails that Dante made were perfectly crafted. I did the huck berry ramp with tequila. Delicious!!! Very nice lady behind the bar also. A leftie like me. Will definitely be back. Had a beer and played some pinball. Good selection of machines. Not the biggest place, but I had a great time! they have an impressive cocktail and whiskey list for a pinball bar!! love the tables they have here, tons of classics but also some new ones. they have games upstairs and downstairs, $15 bucks an hour for everything except the most popular tables. those are one buck per play. definitely recommend coming early for happy hour! every day 2-6 I\u2019m reviewing this purely from a pinball perspective, which I feel is fair given the name of the establishment.\n\nIt costs $15/hour per person for free play on most of the machines here. This price is absolutely absurd for how poorly kept these machines are. On nearly every machine I played I experienced a some combination of a ball getting stuck, poor sound quality, sticky buttons/plunger, broken parts, malfunctioning game mechanics, or improper leveling. Problems like this would usually be excusable and expected on a few machines at an arcade due to typical wear and tear of pinball machines, however given the price you\u2019re paying to play I find this unacceptable.\n\nTo make matters worse, the $15/hour doesn\u2019t even cover all of the machines! There are 3-4 machines that are $1 per play regardless of if you\u2019ve already paid the $15 for an hour of free play.\n\nI\u2019m confident that even if I paid $1 per play on a machine I wouldn\u2019t manage to spend $15 in one hour playing pinball. I\u2019m not that great at pinball but I enjoy it.\n\nI don\u2019t feel like $15/hour is a fair price to charge in the first place and after seeing how poorly a lot of the machines are taken care of, it feels like a scam. It really is family friendly! We brought our Scout troop here for a fun outing. I was nervous because it's a pub, but it was totally cool. We had pizza and soda and played pinball for 2 hours, and the Scouts had a great time. Great selection of games, and the staff was really helpful. Totally recommend!"

    "reviews": "I recently took my family to El Palenque, and as a returning customer, I was thrilled to experience it all over again! We visited on Taco Tuesday, and it truly was a feast for everyone.\n\nOne of the best aspects of El Palenque is the wide variety of options available. My family was able to choose exactly what they wanted, ranging from traditional tacos to delicious vegan and vegetarian selections. As a vegetarian myself, I was delighted to find the vegan tacos\u2014absolutely delicious and perfectly satisfying. The nistamal tortilla added a fantastic touch that made the meal even better!\n\nThe ambience of the restaurant is inviting and vibrant, creating a wonderful atmosphere to enjoy a meal with family. On top of that, the service was excellent\u2014attentive and friendly, making the experience even more enjoyable.\n\nI highly recommend El Palenque for anyone looking to enjoy great food in a family-friendly environment. Taco Tuesday is definitely the highlight of our week now, and we can't wait to return! This Mexican restaurant never disappoints! The service is always pleasant and welcoming. They offer a spacious bar area along with a comfortable dining room. We ordered the steak quesadilla, which was perfectly juicy and tender, with poblano peppers and mushrooms adding incredible flavor.\nMy personal favorite is the saut\u00e9ed camarones in chipotle mushroom cream sauce--juicy, smoky shrimp paired with a sauce that's truly out of this world.\nWe got some churros for a dessert and they were stuffed with chocolate and served alongside a rich caramel sauce.\nEvery visit here is a great experience! This place is the answer to our prayers for vegan Mexican food. The enchiladas were very good, the guac was excellent and I felt they gave us a big portion! All the food felt high quality and done right. They also make a mean bloody Maria. So so good. AND the prices were reasonable \ud83d\udc9aAnthony took great care of us too!! My fiance and I love coming to Palenque! Amazing food and atmosphere. The staff is amazing and accommodating. Very grateful it\u2019s close to home with the food and drinks being as delicious as they are. They offer Gluten Free, Vegan, and Vegetarian options. Also, have a house Margarita! Holy cow it\u2019s delicious! Especially on Mondays when that are two-for-one! First time here and we\u2019d definitely go back! Wish the upstairs rooftop was open, not sure why it was closed on a 73 degree day on a Sunday afternoon."

    "reviews": "After having a rough morning, I decided to stop by here and purchase some beers to take home.\n\nI saw they had kinds that I hadn't tried, so I tried some and decided to have a couple of beers and order lunch.\n\nThe only downside side is the fact that meals don't come with fries, and I wish they did.\n\nI didn't feel very welcomed, but that's normal for me, I suppose, as I'm different from normal crowd. Really impressed with what they\u2019ve done with the place since Jackass Brewing left the spot.  We\u2019ve been a few times and the food and beer have always been great. The duck fat fries are delicious, and a must for us every time.  I really enjoyed the burger and pretzel bites with cheese sauce. DBC Littleton is the first place to make me feel at home since I moved to Colorado a few months ago. All the bartenders are super friendly and attentive and are knowledgeable about the beer! The patio is massive and a great place to bring families/pets, where the indoor bar area is probably better suited for smaller groups as things are a little more cramped. Get the wings, their buffalo sauce is great! Overall a great place to eat and drink and have a good time if you find yourself in downtown Littleton, can't recommend enough, this place has kept me sane and made me feel welcome in a place so far from home!! Great location downtown Littleton easy walk if you're in a Verbo on vacation ,bar food is fresh. The French dip is amazing. The lager was light and crisp and if you like a hoppy IPA it was awesome! 5/14/25 came back still amazing! This location is constantly wonderful. Best staff and best service that I have experienced in Littleton. Heads up based on the recent response, it's pretty common for restaurants and breweries to not allow dogs inside versus them being okay on the patio. Many people have allergies or just don't want dogs in their space while eating food indoors. Not wanting to respect that is a you problem, not a business problem. - love the owner of a 100 lb German Shepherd who adores dogs, but doesn't need them in every space"

The place was mostly empty on a Saturday evening so you can get a table easily. Our first outdoor dining experience of the year and we couldn't have picked a better place.\nThe happy hour specials were great, recommend any of the Black Haus brews.\nThe Cuban and French dip sandwiches were fantastic, the fries were perfect (most places ignore you when you request your fries are cooked well done). Black Haus is an excellent place to go, whether you're looking for a happy hour spot or looking to take your wife on a date. This place has an eclectic choice of food and some delicious drinks. I highly recommend this place. Delicious food!  A bit noisy, but sit outside when the weather allows and it's ok. Great cocktails and excellent appetizers. I can't resist the Tuna Poke appetizer, it's my whole meal. So good! Lots of variety and good service. Nice casual eatery.\n\nUpdate 12/31/2024 - we came in for NYE.  I had a special: Chilean Sea Bass.  This was spectacular! So much going on, asian veggies, wasabi pea puree, edamame, bok choy.  The fish was perfectly cooked and seasoned.  Maybe my favorite meal of 2024!\n\nHubby had the meatloaf.  Good but he says the sauce was a little lacking.\n\nThe winter Cosmo was great.  Nice wine selections. Friendly, down to earth service. We enjoyed the menu options, which were a nice change from a lot of the typical fair on offer in restaurants. The gorgonzola steak pasta was excellent, and my mom enjoyed the meatloaf. The booths are a little awkward, the bench seat is quite low in reference to the table. But that's a minor detail."

Since the food is freshly prepared, there was a bit of a wait, but it was definitely worth it.\n\nI tried both the classic burger and the steak burger.

My only minor suggestion would be to heat the buns as well, as they were a little cool for my liking.\n\nOverall, I would highly recommend Wayback Burger. It's a great spot for a tasty, freshly made burger with excellent service! Absolutely Horrible Service. Ordered a Double Bacon Cheeseburger and received a poorly made excuse of a Single Bacon Cheeseburger. Shows Absolutely No Care or Concern for Customers. Cannot even follow Simple Basic Directions. Never again will I order food from this Horrible Restaurant if you could even call it a Restaurant. Compared to a lot of places in Denver. Service was top notch. The burger was delicious and juicy. The prices were surprisingly affordable. The chicken in the chicken wrap was moist and perfectly seasoned. Fries were perfect. The establishment was clean and well stocked. I was very impressed by the brand and operations. Well done! We came here for the first time today. Jamal, Ashley and Lina waited on us and were friendly and professional. The good service was a breath of fresh air. The burgers were great, too! We'll be coming back. This gem is something else. Cooked as you order so always fresh. The burgers are delicious and I love the variety of them. The shakes are so good and you can never go wrong with their onion rings. I love this place."

The outdoor seating is lovely. And I LOVE the can coffee cups. (Owner, let me know if you want to sell them to me). Came in here for brunch. It was pretty packed so sat In the covered porch area which was super nice. Nice space. Some of the best corned beef I\u2019ve ever had. The bowls are savory and great I added corned beef to mine. Would recommend stopping by here if you are looking for good breakfast food.  Service was kind and the wait for food wasn\u2019t fast but not unreasonable. One of my favorite restaurants. Lots of menu options, friendly, and attentive staff. When they are really busy, the owners are always around to help out. I bring all my out of town guests here for brunch. My favorite is the Southern Benedict with the Chorizo Gravy, you can even sub a fried chicken cutlet for the sausage. I recommend reservations on the weekends.\n\nWhen I'm not with friends, I'll grab a glass a wine on the patio with my faithful companion, Herb. This is a magnificent breakfast spot. Had breakfast on Tuesday got seated immediately. So many great choices it was hard to choose just one thing. I guess I'll have to come back. Our server Mati was very friendly and super attentive. The food is outstanding. I had the Albuquerque Rancher bowl and my friend had the Colorado Bowl. Nothing short of amazing. They're doing breakfast right. Can't wait to come back and try some other items. I was so bummed by this place. I went here with family and we had an hour to eat, around 2pm. The menu looked absolutely amazing and the patio vibes were immaculate. Our server was also incredibly friendly. There were only a few other tables in the restaurant. We ordered an appetizer and four entrees, some cappuccinos, and diet cokes. The cappuccinos were served with just foam milk and flavored water, so the machine was out of beans and we had to send them back. But the main callout is that we *NEVER* got any of our food...not even the appetizer. We had to leave without getting a bite of food and sit through a 2 hour graduation ceremony quite hungry. The server was really apologetic and explained that a lot of the kitchen staff was out that day...but I don't understand why they decided to open if they don't have the staff to man the kitchen. They kept saying \"it's almost ready, it's almost ready,\" but we never even received the appetizer after waiting an hour. It was overall really disappointing and I had been looking forward to trying this restaurant for quite some time. The waitress comped everything, but I felt so bad for her that the owners put that on their waitstaff!"

They made sure everything went smoothly and efficiently.\n\nFor breakfast, we tried the triple decker breakfast sandwich and bourbon French toast. The sandwich was huge and absolutely delicious. The French toast was thick and the syrup was to die for. And guess what? The bacon was just as good as they promised - thick and crispy.\n\nNow, I did notice that parking wasn\u2019t exactly obvious, but there\u2019s a free garage next door, so don\u2019t let that stress you out.\n\nOverall, I had an amazing time at this place. I\u2019ll definitely be back! Bacon Social is a busy brunch place. It was a 1 hour wait on a Sunday morning so make reservations if you can. The Bacon Flight is a must get. We also enjoyed the shrimp and grits but it was slightly on the salty side. The breakfast burrito was also a hit."

    "reviews": "We stumbled upon this place after searching for a nightcap near downtown Littleton. And it turned into such a wonderful experience!! I knew it was going to be great when the bartender immediately greeted us and laid down iced water right away without us even asking. Our bartender Chris was really patient with us as we asked questions about the cocktails. Everything we tried was an absolute delight! I may have found a new favorite in the Tootsie Roll to replace my usual espresso martini. And you have to try the maple old fashioned curated by Chris himself! 10 stars for service, ambience and most importantly the excellent service we got from Chris!! I highly recommend you try everything here! You can\u2019t go wrong! Cheers!! Staff is friendly and drinks are yummy!! The atmosphere is super chill, I've seen parties and live music. There's a patio in the front too. Good food truck outside with great wings!! Parking is usually easy, plenty of street parking, a few spots in the front. Highly recommend Had a private tasting with Dustin and Nick. Wow!! Dustin is very embedded and passionate about the industry and their fantastic whisky. It was a very cool experience and storytelling journey!\n\nThe whisky is, honestly, fantastic! A few of us walked out with 4 bottles! The mixed cocktails are also unique and very delicious! I will be coming back for more hopefully very soon. My boyfriend and I love this place!! They have the best cocktails and finger foods for insanely reasonable prices, especially for how much effort they put into the drinks and food - it\u2019s all so fresh! they also put on all kinds of different private classes on sundays!! highly recommend :) Orders a Sailors Delight with coffee, vermouth and other delicious items. Wonderful drink. The vibe here is so fun with live music tonight(saturday). Singing is our talented bartender Chris. Fun time."

    "reviews": "Outstanding service and incredible food! Every dish was beautifully prepared, and the staff went above and beyond to make our experience memorable. We\u2019re so grateful we were able to get a reservation\u2014it was absolutely worth it! I stopped in for lunch with a group of 5 people total. We had made a reservation in advance. The menu had both breakfast and some sandwich items. Everyone loved the meals they got.\nThe burger was excellent- juicy, good toppings. The fries were coated - not my favorite but good.\nThe cinnamon roll french toast.It seemed to more like a cinnamon roll (not egg dipped) but she loved it all the same.\nEveryone cleared their plates! Lol. Cozy place with an eclectic brunch menu. Several private enclosed and heated patio tables. Reasonable prices for the quality of food and service. Would definitely eat here again! Cafe Terracotta is located in downtown Littleton in a historic Victorian house. Their menu is classic American fare elevated in a unique way. Dinner is served every night every night 4:30pm to 9pm. I highly recommend the Falafel, Brussels Sprout Caesar Salad, Scallops, & Carrot Cake. Our server Monica and Chef Miles took fabulous care of us - our dinner was fantastic, and service was lovely & attentive all around. The space was intimate & warm - reservations highly recommended.\n\nWe started the meal with two mocktails - both were great. The House mocktail was made with seedlip botanic infusion, honey syrup, lime, and hibiscus ginger.\n\nThe Falafel was made with celery root hummus, grilled pita, compressed cucumber, tzatziki, & aleppo oil. The Falafel blew us away and we can see why it\u2019s a favorite at Care Terracotta. The perfectly golden-brown falafel was crisp on the outside & soft inside, bursting with savory chickpea flavor. The hummus & tzatziki added a creamy balance to the dish while the cucumber added a fabulous snap & zing of briny flavor.\n\nThe Brussel Sprout Caesar Salad was made with shredded brussels & romaine, grated parmesan, crispy brussels leaves, dried cranberries, & Caesar dressing. This salad had a fantastic mix of textures (and the flavors were equally exciting) \u2013 I loved the the crispiness of the Brussels sprouts against the sweet chew of the dried cranberries.\n\nThe Burrata was made with grilled sourdough, frisee, & balsamic tomato jam. The burrata was milky & smooth on the crisp, chewy bread.\n\nThe Scallops were perfectly cooked & served with braised cannellini beans, house-smoked bacon, swiss chard, & parsley. The scallops were tender and had good bounce with a melt-in-your-mouth texture. The bacon added a hint of smokey sweetness to each bite.\n\nThe Parisian Gnocchi was made with Italian sausage, Tuscan kale, lemon zest, & grated parmesan. This dish was rich & indulgent. The gnocchi were velvety & the sausage added a savory flavor with a hint of spice. The parmesan added a sharp salty & nutty flavor.\n\nThe 10oz New York Strip was served with crispy beef tallow potatoes, buttered haricot verts, and cognac & peppercorn steak sauce. This was a nice robust piece of meat.\n\nFor dessert, Carrot Cake (& this is the best carrot cake I've had in Colorado!). The sweetness & warm spices of the cake blended perfectly with the cool cream cheese frosting. My mouth is watering just thinking about it now. AMAZING! 100% Make a reservation for brunch beforehand. Emory was the most wonderful hostess, Jesse was our waiter and he was attentive, knowledgeable and personable. We got the Huevos Ranchero with barbacoa, cinnamon roll, traditional Benedict and the carrot cake. Everything was spot on, delicious and really big portions. We will definitely be back as we want to sample the whole menu!"

    "reviews": "I had an awesome time at Littleton Brewing Company! I tried their blackberry seltzer and the Half Moon beer both were so good. The seltzer was super refreshing and light, making it the perfect drink to sip while hanging out. The Half Moon beer was crisp and light too, with a really clean finish that made it easy to enjoy.\n\nThe atmosphere was a blast they were hosting trivia when I was there, which made the whole place feel lively and fun. Plus, you can\u2019t beat the amazing mountain views from the brewery. Between the great drinks, the fun vibe, and the scenery, Littleton Brewing Company is definitely a spot I\u2019ll be coming back to and I\u2019m so glad it\u2019s in the neighborhood! I've been waiting for this place to open for a couple of years. It was worth the wait! I've gone twice already, once at a \"soft opening,\" and then again lined up for the Grand Opening. LB released 8 beers so far on draft, and I have tried them all. My favorites are the Lemongrass wheat (great flavor and so easy), the Half Moon (another crisp, slightly fruity and easy drinker), and the Recalibration hazy (a less hoppy and slightly sweeter than your typical hazy IPA). I found all their beers drinkable, which is great because the location is amazing. The rooftop view is the best of any brewery you will find! There is also a lot of space and plenty of tables on the ground level outside, inside and up on the rooftop. Plenty of room for your dog too, as my pup, Sadie, already loves this spot. Once the bar on the rooftop opens, soon I am told, it will be even better. I can also speak to the pizza and pretzel as both are made in-house and taste fantastic and pair great with their beers.\nAs far as parking, there are really only a couple of spaces, but parking on the side street there is free and pretty convenient. If you haven't checked this place out yet, there is a reason the line for the grand opening was blocks long by the time they opened!\n\nEdit: I've now also had their burger and fries. The burger packs plenty of meat (two patties), so very filling. The patties are done smash style, and while I'm normally a thick, medium-rare burger guy, this smash style was still delicious. My wife, who is particular with food, also loved the burger. This place just keeps getting better! Magical roof top and yard to drink in with fire pits, the smash burger and fries are great and filling.  Upstairs has cool views of the mountains.  Some not too crazy beers on tap. Beers, vibes, and views!!  The beers are delicious, loved the IPAs and the Lemongrass Wheat.  The staff is super friendly and helpful, and the views of the mountains from the roof deck are amazing.  Also love their swag. We are super excited about this new brewery in Colorado and can\u2019t wait to go back. Worth the wait!  We live close by and have watched this vacant lot transform into what it is today.  You can tell the owners thought of every little detail resulting in an awesome aesthetic and welcoming space.  Friendly staff, great selection of beers, and the pizzas are very solid (Connecticut transplant here so my bar on pizza is high \ud83d\ude42).  GREAT addition to the neighborhood!"

We happened to be nearby, and my wife is part of the tribe. Man some of the best latkes I have ever had. Crunchy, soft on inside, super flavorful. We got one with eggs. And the Reuben. Wow. The sauerkraut was so tasty and the sauce he used. Great place wish it was closer to home. Highly recommend!!!! There is a to (Latke) Love about this place. The food is absolutely amazing. I got a Reuben latke plate, the special. It cost $19, but it was completely loaded, with lots of great tasting pastrami.\nThe staff is also very warm and friendly. I was happy to be served here. It's a small place, but cozy.  Food is amazing. Owner is friendly and funny. Steve is amazing. I was a Thursday regular for years but then moved away for two years. The first time I walked back in after moving back he remembered my name and cooked up an amazing Rabbi. Steve always makes you feel like you are at home and the food is consistently 10/10. This was my first time going to this place with my significant other and it was amazing.  The owner gives you the run down of all the delicious menu options and the dishes are beautifully presented. I ordered the Baleboosteh dish and it was definitely worth every penny. I definitely recommend stopping by this place- especially when you want a comfort meal!!"

    "reviews": "Absolutely love this place! Best Tacos I have found in the Littleton area! The food was amazing and had so much flavor! The meat was juicy and tender. Can\u2019t wait to come back for a breakfast burrito! I used Famous Amos Tacos to cater an event and was so happy with the experience! Amos was super accommodating, handled the setup, and the food was a hit\u2014everyone loved it. You definitely need him at your next event!\n\nAlso, if you haven\u2019t tried the bacon breakfast burrito with crispy potatoes and the charro beans\u2026 so good! This doesn\u2019t even start to begin how sad this plate of nachos is. We came here because the pictures looks absolutely delicious. Sodas don\u2019t have any ice and are lukewarm. \u201cNachos\u201d barely have any cheese and is mainly beans and sour cream. The chicken is good. So that\u2019s all that there is to say about this. Don\u2019t recommend this place at all. 42$ for 2 plates of this sadness and 3 sodas. Absurd. Very excited to get a breakfast burrito, but unfortunately no one was at the truck for me to order. Waited over 5 minutes and had to just leave (had to get to work). If you have to step away and you're running the truck solo, I get it. But a sign giving a heads up would be useful because I wasn't sure how much longer it would be. I'm definitely gonna try again, but just dropping an FYI for now. I'll update the review when I get some food! Okay, this is a food truck, not a brick and mortar store....so hard to rate \"atmosphere\" or  \"table wait time\". The food, though, I can rate... and it was not good. I had the smothered green chile chicken enchiladas with rice and beans. The dish had almost no flavor... very bland. A little salt would've helped a \"little\" but there was none. I ordered two barbacoa tacos for my girlfriend and put in the special instructions box \"no cilantro please\", as cilantro tastes like soap to some people like her. Well, guess what... they had cilantro and she tried picking it out but there's no way to do so. And that red taco sauce... worst tasting sauce we've ever tasted. Just a big ol' mouth of bitterness. Green sauce was good, so I used it to add some flavor to my enchiladas, which needed it. What was good? Oh... the beans... they were good."

    "reviews": "I've eaten at this Black Eyed Pea a few times now, takeout and dine in, and every time my meal leaves something to be desired. I'm not a picky eater in the slightest, for what it's worth. Hand to god. I would recommend going pretty much anywhere else, there are lots of tasty places at this price point that will give you a meal that's a billion times better.\n\nThey do have some tasty appetizers and dishes but nothing that really stands out. Everything else, ranges from subpar to inedible. The peach cobbler tasted horrible, like peach flavored baby oil soaked into prison bread. Meatloaf is a good $25 and it's not bad, but it's school lunch quality and does not reflect it's price point at all. All that being said, the staff are kind and the atmosphere is pleasant.\n\nPlease, I beg you, ask your elderly companion who wants to dine here to go elsewhere. Please!! Our waitress was amazing. Very attentive and not overly so. The chicken fried steak was good. Tender and flavorful while still being crispy on the outside. The mashed potatoes were real. There were even some chunks in them. The gravy was good and had some good black pepper in it. The salad was okay. Probably would not get it again. My daughter said the macaroni and cheese was decent. The food was good- I especially liked the chopped grilled chicken salad with the delicious blue cheese dressing. Hubby had the turkey dinner which was fine. The rolls are fresh, fluffy and delicious. Our waiter, Junior, is just the nicest guy who enjoys and takes pride in his job. Prices are good so we always double our tip for him. I hope he works his way up to manager one day. I have never eaten here. It usually looks like a ghost town. Today my boyfriend and I decided to stop in. Waitress was very friendly and attentive. Bread was warm and soft. Big menu with alot of home style dinner options. We got the chicken fried steaks with jalapeno gravy and glazed carrots, corn and fries. The chicken fried steak was pretty good, decent size that wasn't massive. Glazed carrots, corn and fries were good. The jalapeno gravy was more like white gravy with just diced jalapenos thrown in instead of simmered in. It was just okay. But overall, I liked it. It's a bit pricey but if they did an all-day value menu option (like Chili's 3 for Me for $10.99 and Applebee's 2 can Dine $25) and advertised it heavily, maybe it'd get more people in. This location looked clean, no issues with our table or atmosphere. Would stop in again for sure Service is always good, but it's hard to find food without meat or that isn't fried. It's good, but not the healthiest."

    "reviews": "We ordered online and picked up in store.  My tortilla soup was a naked burrito and a small cup of the soupwhich honestly tasted terrible.  Something was definitely wrong with the soup.  The other burritos that we ordered were missing the cheese and sour cream.  And honestly, the food just tasted off.  Honestly super disappointed. My wife and I got here right when they opened. A lady unlocked the door and opened it for us. She greeted us with a smile. Then she went back behind the counter. Another lady asked what we wanted we both ordered a Chicken Bowl. It hit the spot for me. Came here a few times before a shift in Englewood. I really like their shrimp burrito. But the last few times they didn\u2019t have shrimp ready. They told me they don\u2019t have it ready because I\u2019m the only one who eats it around that time and they can only have it out for 1 hour after they cook it. So I was on my way over there again today and I called ahead of time. Someone named Tristan answered. I told them that I am on my way over and asked if they could throw some shrimp on the grill for me. He hung up. I will not be back to this location. I go to this Qdoba not for sustenance, but to test the limits of human engineering and moral sanity. I order a burrito so egregiously large, it should come with a liability waiver and an exorcist. We\u2019re talking double steak, a biblical flood of beans, rice measured in cubic meters, and so much weight the counter sags when they roll it.\n\nMost places would call the cops. Or a priest. But not this Qdoba.\n\nNo. These absolute warriors welcome me like I\u2019m a regular at a Fight Club for carbohydrates. They don\u2019t flinch. They don\u2019t judge. Sometimes it takes two employees and a whispered prayer in Latin to close it, and they STILL smile and ask how my day\u2019s going. They remember personal details about my life \u2014 which means they\u2019re not just burrito artisans, they\u2019re emotional support shamans.\n\nThis crew? Legends. Heroes. Victims of my black hole burrito, yes \u2014 but brave ones.\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for a place where you can live without shame, where your food can double as a blunt-force weapon, where customer service meets psychological resilience, this is it.\n\nFive stars. No not We order catering and the staff were very friendly and on it. They called beforehand to confirm the order and had everything ready when we got there. Very friendly staff and they gave us free entree cards when we returned the trays. Thank you so much!"

    "reviews": "Place has gone downhill quick. They used to be on point. Now the burgers smell like fish, not sure how that\u2019s happening but they are inedible at times. The orders are always wrong. The workers have a bad attitude. They need to clean house and start fresh. Those burgers are probably sitting out all day for them to smell that way. Why is it back on the edges. It doesn\u2019t taste burnt. Just fishy We had great service at this Wendy's thanks to Dee! As we ate, we noticed the main server behind the counter literally running her legs off. The service was fast, considering the crowd, and it couldn't have been done any more efficiently. It seemed like all the staff were working as hard and fast as they could. I decided to ask this fantastic employee who she was and her position. Her name was Dee and she was the manager. Thank you to Wendy's for having such wonderful, caring employees like Dee! Dee.... you made our day! Lady was licking her fingers as she was making my frosty. I also ordered extra onions and literally just got one ring of onion. Sad.... I came in to order because I thought I was gonna dine in. When I got to the front to order I noticed the cashier was new. She asked her manager Christine for help on which button to push and was met with annoyance and anger. This very unprofessional \"manager\" with no respect for her employees yelled and this new cashier. How are you gonna leave a NEW employee by herself at the register without knowing the ins and out of the register and then yell at her for it. This happened June 3rd I debated posting this, I just hope something changes. Usually don\u2019t have too many issues here, but today I received not one but two undercooked spicy chicken sandwiches. I now have to figure out another meal because this one was inedible."

    "reviews": "I'm hesitant to write this review... but only because I don't want everyone to find out about this place!!!\nI have been searching for a place locally that has *quality ingredients and tastes GREAT. I have been focusing on eating better quality foods and that includes narrowing down where I can eat pizza. And this place fits that requirement!\nThey have pizza with limited ingredients in their dough. They have low moisture mozzarella cheese and their pizza just tastes DELICIOUS.\nI am already looking forward to going back. My favorite pizza right now is the Verdi, but with red sauce and all mozzarella cheese. It's so freakin' good! My husband always goes for the BBQ Chicken, but the Cheeseburger pizza is also delicious!\nAlso, the staff here is so friendly and kind. Thank you for making this restaurant an all-around great experience! I love this food, restaurant concept, and always make dining here a priority when I'm in this part of Denver. I recommend the BBQ Chicken pizza, no BBQ sauce/substituting Spicy Cashew sauce but with cheese and adding Jalapenos. If you're looking for a salad, the Solstice never fails to satisfy.\nTop it all off with a cookie to satisfy your sweet experience.\nHealthiest pizza and best owner I've ever encountered. I do their service for knives and I always looked forward to Thursdays. The family vibe and relaxed environment and pleasant energy shows in what you make. Staff is attentive and the teamwork is so great to see. Got a pizza to go on my last day and it did not disappoint. I think I could actually eat this pizza everyday and feel healthy. It had a super thin crust (props, that\u2019s a hard thing to master) and fresh basil everywhere! Finally, a margarita pizza with enough basil spread evenly. You are all so special to all of your employees and it seems to beam a casual vibe in the dining room. Very welcoming and un-intimidating.\nJeff, you\u2019re the man! Anyone would be lucky working under your management My husband and I just had the worst customer service experience at Sazza. We ordered our food, and at the counter there were some bread strips with oil and vinegar. My husband thought they were samples and got one. An employee behind the counter smiled at him as he did it, so he assumed it was fine to take them. He was very hungry so went back to get a few more. He grabbed a plate from where they are easily within reach of customers and fixed himself a little appetizer. Nobody said anything, and he assumed they were there for the taking. We were sitting at the table, and a man who I later learned is the manager came up and asked, \"Did one of my friends get that for you?\" My husband answered that they had not. The manager then snatched the plate up and said, \"Don't touch my stuff,\" as he walked away. My husband said, \"I'm so sorry,\" and then we sat in shock for a few seconds. My husband went back to the counter and asked politely if we could have the food to go. I started to feel uncomfortable after the manager's rude treatment. A mistake was made, but it was unintentional. I had paid with my card, so I said I was going to ask for a refund so we could leave. I approached the counter, and the employee behind it said they were getting our order together. The manager was over by the plates in the hallway. I said, \"No, we just want our money back because he was very rude.\" I pointed in the manager's direction. The manager said nothing, and just started to laugh at me, as did two other employees who were standing there. This angered my husband, who started yelling at the manager and walked toward him. The manager then pushed my husband, and they continued to laugh at us. After a little more yelling, my husband walked out of the side door as I waited for my refund. One kind employee asked me what had happened, and I explained, and then another kind employee started working on my refund. Meanwhile, another customer apparently asked the waiter what had happened, and I heard him start to tell the customer that the manager had gone over and politely told us something about the bread strips. I interrupted his story to explain what had actually happened. If the manager had come up and said, \"These aren't for customer self-service. Next time please ask us,\" we would've apologized profusely and insisted on paying for the bread strips. Instead, he snapped at us and then added to the insult by mockingly laughing when I said he was rude. He even could've salvaged the situation by apologizing for his rudeness when we approached the counter for the refund. If he had said, \"I apologize if I came across as rude,\" nobody would've yelled, and we probably would've apologized for the mistake and left with our pizza. Instead, he chose to escalate it more by laughing, which other employees also did. My husband did get verbally heated, but there was no need for the manager to put hands on him. The waiter who had laughed did apologize to me on the way out. I thanked him for his apology, but it was all too late. The whole situation could've been avoided with a little tact and customer service skill. It's unfortunate because we will never go back. Sazza's food is fresh and delicious. You walk up to order, and they bring out the food. Staff does monitor and refresh drinks. It's a bit noisy inside, with limited sitting but pleasant. The lunch special is a good value."

    "reviews": "Ordered the family special (cheese and pepperoni), for pickup.  Pizza was lukewarm and very thin, twice as thin as New York style is traditionally made. For example, when held to the light the pizza turned translucent and was stiff as cardboard.  Honestly, I really used to like this place, but the past several times it has been disappointing. Parry's Pizzaria in Greenwood Village delivers NY-style pizza perfection with a massive beer list. The pizza is award-worthy, with a crispy crust, generous toppings, and just the right amount of chew. Friendly service and a casual pub vibe make it a great spot for pizza lovers and beer enthusiasts alike. We really enjoyed it! Order the Uncle Sam pizza. Pizza was one the bartender said was popular.    It came out hot and crispy.  Pizza was thin and had a good amount of toppings.  Sauce was sweet.   Undercarriage was a little crispy.   Crust was thin but wasn't cardboard.    Pizza was overall good.  Service was great and friendly.    The restaurant was downstairs and had an industrial feel with a 1/2 brick wall that looked really cool.\n\nCrust - 4/10 (not my fav style)\nSauce -6/10\nUndercarriage - 6.4/10\nPizza overall - 6.8/10\n\nWould definitely recommend it to anyone in this area. As a New Yorker let me tell you this is my favorite pizza and wings in Denver! The service is great (shout out to our awesome server tonight Ariana), the food is delicious, the prices and specials are incredible, and the atmosphere is perfect for watching our favorite sports games. I honestly cannot believe this place isn\u2019t packed every night. Could not recommend them more highly. I wanted this place to be good so bad because we live close by, but the pizza has disappointed time and time again. They\u2019re clearly struggling in some sort of way because they are skimping hard on ingredients. Main issue is how thin the base is on the NY pizzas. Don\u2019t expect many toppings either. Usually did sausage and green peppers and you\u2019d be lucky to get much per slice, but the much bigger issue is how ultra thin they make them. It wouldn\u2019t even matter if it was cheap because it still wouldn\u2019t be worth it, but it\u2019s pretty expensive. The pizza is warm at best when you pick up. I would get there early and it wouldn\u2019t make a difference. Such a waste of money. It\u2019s like eating cardboard. See other reviews, similar experience."

    "reviews": "This place is amazing! Definitely smart to join the waitlist online before you get there. Service is always amazing, the wait staff know the menu front and back and helped to make any necessary changes due to allergies or just preferences (half of my family is vegetarian and dairy free). I spilled a drink and within seconds there were people running to clean it up and a new one was delivered. It was recommended to me to get the Cure fresh juice and add their homemade infused pineapple vodka, it was amazing!! Same with their Bloody Mary\u2019s! This place is amazing. You have to try it. I am headed back to Denver soon and this will be at the top of my list. I try avocado toast in many places and this was one of the best. Our waiter, James, was super knowledgeable and personable. Thanks for the experience. Breakfast/lunch restaurant with comparable prices to other similar establishments. They have a range of the usual items on the menu the rancher omelet was very good. I liked the pork sausage that came in it and the gravy. The strawberries and grapes were very good and the pineapple was close. The melons were not ripe though which is often the case in US restaurants.\n\nService was fast, friendly and attentive. The space is large and pleasant. It wasn't quiet, but the noise level wasn't too loud. They do have Wi-Fi for customers.\n\nThe restaurant is about a half block from a garage with 3 hour free parking plus there may be spots on street if you're early. Had a great breakfast with my brother. I got the chilaquiles, biscuits and gravy, and a chai tea. Chai was spicy enough and tasted great. The biscuits were just a little dry, but the gravy was good. The chilaquiles were on point, but I wish it was spicier. Overall, it was a great breakfast place, and it was SUPER busy. Good sign for a good place. omg I LOVE coming to urban egg. Their avocado toast is SO GOOD. Their spicy bloody Mary\u2019s? I\u2019ll have 3. The biscuits and gravy are yummy and the coconut dream pie drink is a must have. If you don\u2019t drink, their fresh juices are good too! I also can\u2019t get over their Denver hot chicken dish \ud83e\udd0c\ud83c\udffc"

    "reviews": "First time there and I will never be back.  Service was below average and we had to send our appetizer plates back because they all were either wet or had food stains on them.  I asked for extra napkins and was told \u201cthey are up by the bar if you want them.\u201d  We ordered our burgers medium rare and all four came back well done.\n\nThen to top it all off, we were hit with a mandatory 20% service fee that was a complete shock to us.  They took the decision to tip away from us, which we would have done anyway.  It is not the customer\u2019s job to make sure the front and back house staff are equally compensated.\n\nI\u2019ve seen 5% service charges before, but 20% is ridiculous, especially when you aren\u2019t made aware of it up front.  This may have been the shadiest business practice I have ever experienced at a restaurant.\n\nDon\u2019t waste your time or money on this place.  Harsh review, but eating out is expensive these days.  If you are going to spend $180+ for a family of four on burgers, fries and 5 beers, you deserve to be blown away by the experience. The service was disappointing. They failed to inform us about the 20% service fee upfront. We ordered burgers, but they were undercooked and seemed steamed rather than grilled. When we brought this up with the manager, she was unhelpful and rude. We ended up eating half the burgers before throwing them away. Overall, not recommended. Waitress set the expectation of there being a 20% tip added to the bill automatically. Which fine whatever, but then proceeded to get bad service. We got the wrong drinks and had to hunt her down to reorder. There\u2019s plenty of options within walking distance that are better I've been to Tap & Burger four times now thanks to a networking meeting.\n\nI've tried the classic smash which is a double patty with American cheese, shaved onion, tomato, lettuce, pickle, their secret sauce on a harvest moon bun. Very tasty. Even with the double patty it is a bit small.\n\nI also tried the Tap House Smash and it is a filling burger. It has a lot of toppings and I added an extra patty so it was over the top. The BBQ pork burnt ends made it fairly sweet. I could taste the pork and beef but not the cheese or shaved and fried onion straws. I'm glad I tried it but wouldn't order it again.\n\nThe first few times I did not see the lunch menu which is a great value. You get a entree, side and drink (upcharge for beer) for $12 before tax and tip. I went with the chicken bacon hot honey ranch wrap. It has a good kick and the chicken is grilled. They serve the drinks in large cups which is nice so you're not taking a few sips and then needing a refill.\n\nThe servers have always been friendly and helpful. In particular Abby W has been the server twice and she is what you want in a server. She answers any questions I've had and is great at taking the order and getting food, drink and bill in an efficient manner. Kudos Abby.\n\nThe parking is easy either on the street out front or side or there may be a parking garage (have never had to seek that out). Tap & Burgers bar is a delightful spot for burger aficionados. From the moment you walk in, the aroma of sizzling patties tantalizes your senses. The food is undeniably amazing, with each bite bursting with flavor. But it's not just the food that shines; the service is exceptional too. Our waitress was both friendly and professional, ensuring our dining experience was nothing short of stellar.\n\nHowever, there were a couple of minor hiccups. The happy hour menu and hours weren't entirely accurate, which could be a tad disappointing for those seeking deals. Yet, the shining star of our visit was undoubtedly the supervisor, Mikki. Her attentiveness and helpfulness turned our slight inconvenience into a non-issue. Kudos to her for her outstanding service. Overall, Tap & Burgers is a must-visit for burger enthusiasts, offering a delicious culinary experience with top-notch service."

    "reviews": "The food was delicious, especially the bottomless mimosas and the morning margaritas! I totally recommend the Irish nachos, it\u2019s been a few days and I\u2019m still thinking about how delicious they were. The Fish and Chips were great. Both the quantity and quality of the fish is great. The coleslaw and fries that came with the fish was very good too. They also have a nice variety of beer on tap. Was able to be seated quickly. Food was great but came out all at once, so there was not much room on the table.\n\nThe pretzels were to die for. I got the shepherds pie. I did not like it. It also came with a soup or salad. I got the soup. It wad a pork green chili and amazing good.\n\nOur table was not ideal. We sat right against the wall and it was hard with 6 people to fit well.\n\nThe waiter was great. Would still recommend the restaurant. Our First Friday Food group celebrated Saint Patrick's Day early to sample a variety of Irish Pub food. We loved the crunchy Brussels w/ hint of balsamic reduction. The Shepherd's pie serving was generous, rightly seasoned. Several participants went with flaky fish & chips, well+done/ not greasy! Corn Beef & cabbage was delicious, and lamb stew a \"Foodie favorite\" our server was dynamic, responsive and helpful! This is one of my favorite places to eat!  Love the location and restaurant!  It\u2019s so much fun here.  Service is usually very quick and staff is very friendly!  The Ahi Tuna Salad is the best!"

    "reviews": "We were searching for a new place to try in the area and stumbled across this place and decided to give them a try.\n\nWe ordered several beer drafts along with the Nick's sandwich and the Heat Wave burger. Both sandwiches were delicious and cooked to perfection.  The Heat Wave had the perfect kick. The Tater Tots were also very delicious.\n\nThe waitress was awesome,  she was very nice and friendly and very attentive. We enjoyed the atmosphere as it was very friendly and welcoming. Overall,  we had a great dinning experience. We hope to stop back in soon. Fun atmosphere excellent service (thanks Karlie), great food.  The Bacon Cheeseburger on Steroids was great (a lot of food).  The jalapeno bacon was killer.  6 strips of bacon!!! Onion rings were solid, crunchy outside and a hint of sweet inside.  Homemade chips are great (I like chips a little darker and there was a great selection of both).  Buffalo chicken sandwich was a hit at the table too.  Will be back! We had such a great experience this afternoon thanks to Genevieve. She was kind, attentive, and had a great sense of timing! Not too much, not too little, just right. It felt like she genuinely enjoyed taking care of her tables, which made the whole afternoon feel relaxed and enjoyable. The food was great, but her service is what will bring us back. A real bright spot in our day! Good burger joint in DTC. Their burgers are reasonably priced. I like that you can opt for sides or not and you have the ability to build your own burger. The burgers were good and juicy and the truffle Parmesan fries were great. Servers were soo nice! Attentive even tho they were busy!\nOnly reason why I rated 4 stars instead of 5 is because my friend\u2019s burger was soggy and dry at the same time. The bun was wrinkled and wet while the ingredients inside were dry..\nthe server was very gracious and took it off our bill as my friend could not get more than a couple bites in.\nMy burger was great and I think we would come back to try happy hour as our drinks were delicious!!"

Has a southern vibe and very homey. I ordered the Griffin Lemonade. It was delicious! OMG \ud83d\ude31 amazing cute place you have to try! It has a great little happy hour menu. The wings were fantastic. I did the barbecue bourbon. Staff was incredibly helpful. I also had an old fashion that came out. Perfect. I don\u2019t know how much I like my old fashions. The amazing manager also let me have a couple of the tequila bottles that I had been wanting to be able to make a oil dispenser out of so again best service fantastic people huge bar to sit at enough parking to fill this place twice over. You should not have one problem finding parking. Some friends and I meet here at Griffin Tavern quarterly for a real estate investors meet-up, and the staff is always incredibly accommodating and friendly! We have about 8-10 people on average and they\u2019re very kind about getting us plenty of seating. The fries here are excellent, the drinks are very affordable! 2 Gin and Tonics for 12 bucks! I\u2019ll take it. This was my second time at Griffin Tavern. The atmosphere is great. We ordered a few appetizers to share which were all delicious. I recommend the sliders.  I enjoyed my drink. The service was slow, but the waitress was kind. I would go back."

    "reviews": "My daughter took me and entire family here. She made a 7pm appointment and they let us in 15 min later.\nThe place is nice and well decorated. The servers were nice, but I have a complain to 1 of the lead server, I feel like he was not too friendly, but maybe he was tired so it was okay.\nThe foods are good, I love the lobster tail, the scallops and the sea bass. Steak are juicy but the pasta is so so.\nOverall, it was a nice dinner with family. Thank you John (GM) for making my birthday lunch memorable. This was my first time there and was impressed when I first walked in. The service and food was amazing, if you find yourself in the DTC area stop in this place. So many options for a lunch menu. I chosen the fish sandwich with the the spicy coleslaw. Never had a fish sandwich that delicious before. I will be coming back soon... Took my mom there because she was visiting me in CO and I wanted to treat her to an early Mother's Day dinner. The food was exceptional and our waiter Shane was knowledgeable and very personable. Big shout out to the assistant server Valerie. She was very attentive and made the whole experience that much more enjoyable.\n\nThe sea bass was perfection and the lamb was cooked beautifully. My thanks to the whole Ocean Prime staff for helping me make my mom's trip more memorable. I definitely will be back. Excellent service in every way from beginning to start. For the food I\u2019ll say this Strak is good but not the best. Sides were excellent. Phenomenal creamed spinach and the Brussels I enjoyed as well. Now the spotlight is there peanut butter chocolate pie, OUTSTANDING one of the best deserts you will every have and I don\u2019t even like peanut butter!! We visited for the first time on my wife's Birthday, and it won't be our last.  What a wonderful experience.  Fantastic food, service and atmosphere.  Every dish was amazing.  From the bread bowl, tuna tartar, scallops, filet, lobster mac to the carrot cake, every bite was delicious. We will be back soon."

    "reviews": "This was my first time there and it was for a friends birthday dinner and it was amazing. The staff the moment we entered were all friendly and helpful. We were sat right away even though out full party was not there. Other staff came by regularly to make sure we were good in drinks and food. If we asked a waitress or waiter that was not ours they were not bothered by this and were very polite and respectful with their help. The food was delicious. I had the California rolls for an appetizer and the Hawaiian chicken for dinner. I would highly recommend this place for date night or girls night out. \ud83e\udd42\ud83c\udf7e First time here, the atmosphere was good, nice decor, reminds me of a club setting but this was way better. The food was very good, we were a party of 8 so we opted to get lots of smaller dishes to share. The sea bass was awesome, the salt and pepper ribs were excellent.  Awesome sake selection. Overall a great experience for me. If you go\u2026take both wallets, but it\u2019s worth it. Came for valentines day and had an absolute blast. Our servers name was Katie and she was just awesome! She recommended the waygu beef app cooked on a lava rock at your table and it was incredible!\nI had the lemon grass salmon per her recommendation and it just melted in my mouth\nLou, the manager, was a complete delight to talk to as well!\nNot to mention the amazing atmosphere The champagne vinaigrette on the salad was delicious. The crab Rangoon\u2019s also very tasty with an amazing sauce to go with it. The sesame chicken was the best I have had. Flavorful, juicy not over cooked. The service was great from everybody, but my waitress. The host set us right away. The atmosphere is absolutely beautiful on both sides of the dining room and the bar area. The real reason I went, was to give the experience of the bus button, which is in there, drunken Buddha drink. If you\u2019ve never had one, it\u2019s a definite, let\u2019s try. It was actually the very first time I was ever introduced to this buzz button was at this location years ago. They even make their own lemonade. Parking in the area is not a problem. They have a great parking garage right across the street. Luckily for me I was able to park street in front of the street. The restaurant has 2 sides. We sat on the lounge side. There were 8 of us but the wait staff took care of us as if we were sitting right at the bar. Staff in general were GREAT! Our food came out promptly, drinks were amazing. Overall a great experience and beautiful restaurant.\n\n*Picture posted is the fried cauliflower appetizer"

    "reviews": "Artichoke dip was on point. the pot stickers were crispy and delicious. However not a big fan of the entrees. My salad was soggy like it had been sitting in the sauce for a minute. The rice with the mahi had a weird texture to it. Some of the food was good, but anything that had bell peppers used jarred bell peppers which ruined that item. We got the blacked chicken penne and beef satay (bell pepper items) and strawberry spinach salad and lemon chicken. The jarred bell peppers brought the whole meal down. I would say stay away from the bell pepper items. Lemon chicken and salad were pretty good! Manhattan and tiger something smash were low quality. The food was delicious! The flavors were nice and balanced but the portions were a bit on the small size. The old fashioned was just ok, and the color a bit lighter than expected, but overall, we would dine here before a comedy show again. This place was okay overall. The server was very nice and helpful! The food was okay. It came out within 20 minutes which is great, but it makes me skeptical sometimes. The steak appetizer came out within 5 minutes which was nice. It was not as tender as we were hoping for, and it could have used more sauce.\n\nThe chicken club was good and my boyfriend ate all of his linguine! My dad had the blackened chicken penne pasta, and he said it was fairly bland and a bit too soupy. An amazing experience before the comedy show. The food was delicious and the service was superb. We will visit again.  The seared tuna and seafood linguine were delicious."

If I hadn't been so full, I could have eaten another one.\n\nGarlic mashed potatoes, broccoli and the lobster mac and cheese were all delightful.\n\nI can't wait to bring my Dad next time he comes to visit. One of the best steakhouses in the country. And I am a steakhouse junkie!  A must do. Fantastic escargot, grilled octopus, and the best lamb chops in North America! Don't skip dessert. Had the lemon cake which was delicate, refreshing, and exquisite. Props to the pastry chef! Don't skip the wine list. Don't skip a cocktail. This one is worth it! Ask for Richard , one of the best waiters we've ever had. He gets food, he gets service and he leans in to your culinary experience! Had a phenomenal time at Shanahan's! Everything was cooked perfectly. And service was impeccable. Love the marinade for the Satay (beef skewers which tasted like a sweet-soy Japanese Tare marinade and paired perfectly with a peanut sauced salad like the traditional  South East Asian Satay) Food was okay, I feel like it could be better. We got calamri for appetizer our favorite at any restaurant and we got steaks and it was served in a piping hot plate so it was still cooking while you're eating to keep it warm too. The drinks was good and the service was excellent. Very loud though so it's a little bit hard to hear, wish I could post a video. We spent about $300 for the two of us and on our way out we got to see the trophies. Overall we still had a nice experience. Can\u2019t speak about the service enough! Amazing place with amazing staff and atmosphere! Everything was cooked perfectly and service was top notch! Quick tip! If you ask the waitress to hold the Super Bowl trophy, they will let you!!!"

Perfectly thick and crispy! If you're ever in Denver, this is a must-try spot.\n\nTag a friend who loves a good brunch and let\u2019s plan a foodie trip! \ud83c\udf0e\u2728\n\n#BreakfastLovers #PancakesAndBacon #FoodieAdventures #DenverEats #ComidaDeliciosa #PancakesPerfectos #BaconTime #BrunchGoals #ColombiaEats #MexicoFoodie #BrazilFoodLover #Del\u00edciasMatinais This place is phenomenal. The servers are friendly, authentic yet bubbly and clearly passionate about the food. The food is nothing short of spectacular. They bake the Dutch baby pancakes fresh hourly. The eggnog French toast was delish! Bacon is thick and perfectly cooked. We went Saturday at 10 am and the wait was 45 min+ but worth it!!! The Original Pancake House is one of our favorite places to go for breakfast. They have amazing selections of pancakes, waffle, omelet, crepes, and eggs. Their signature specialty, Dutch Baby, and Apple pancake are both delicious and very impressive to look at. My personal favorites are Dutch Baby, strawberry crepes, 49'er flap jacks, and potato pancakes, but you can't go wrong with any selections, and you will want to go back to try everything! Be sure to get on the waitlist before you head over, especially on the weekends and holidays, as they are always packed, but it well worth the wait! OPH is a very popular breakfast destination with an extensive selection of pancakes and crepes plus the other usual breakfast options including omelets, benedicts and the like. The food is excellent. I particularly like the pumpkin pancakes, the cherry crepes and the Swedish pancakes. The baked apple pancake is very good, but way too much food. With some choices you can order a half portion (3 pancakes) which is nice. The coffee is good.\n\nThe place can be very busy, but you can join the waitlist on-line before you arrive. The servers and other staff are friendly and efficient. Turnover of tables is very fast as diners finish and leave. The wait I was quoted was 20 minutes when I arrived, but was actually only 5 minutes. There is also a heated outdoor patio.\n\nThere is plenty of parking available. This restaurant never fails! They are always consistent with their food. The staff is so friendly- they try to get you seated as fast as possible when the wait is long. The food also comes out quickly even when it\u2019s crazy busy! Everything on the menu is so delicious you really can\u2019t go wrong with anything you order."

Ordered the duck and fig pizza, honestly it was so good. I love that it\u2019s a wood fire pizza. I loved their Smokey walnut old fashion too! We ate here before a comedy show and I would def come again. They have the best pizza in DTC. A classic done right! Their Margherita pizza has that irresistible charred crust and fresh, vibrant flavors you crave. They have many options for drink as well. I will visit them again. The garlic bread appetizer was thick, but light and airy and a sizable portion. Delicious dipping marinara, too. The beet and arugula salad was tasty. The margherita pizza was decent -- crispy and flavorful sauce. Stuffed shells had a spicy marinara, which worked excellently with the ricotta.\n\nThe waitress Sarah was on top of her game: keeping our waters full and checking in on us.\n\nAtmosphere is modern, spacious, and well lit. What a great experience! We reserved a table for 6 mid-week to celebrate my father's 80th birthday... The atmosphere was quiet and casual   and our wait person was attentive to our needs. We ordered the veggie pizzas. They came out quickly and were delicious! We devoured then and decided to do a made-to-order pizza because they were so good! A wonderful surprise was when our wait person brought a tiramisu out with a candle to celebrate my Dad. Definitely a place we'll go back to for yummy pizzas! We love this pizza place.  It\u2019s in a great area at Greenwood Village and offers plenty of parking spots. They have a great bar menu with wine, beer, mixed drinks, coffee.  They have a happy hour menu 4-6pm.  They have a great selection of appetizers, pizzas, pastas, salads, and great dessert.  We didn\u2019t have a reservation but they were able to accommodate us.  They were friendly and the service was great.\nThe restaurant also is great for large parties, small parties as well as family restaurant with kiddos."

    "reviews": "Pretty large fine dining seafood restaurant with also a beautiful outdoor dining available. We tried half dozen oysters, house salad, Atlantic halibut picatta, and rainbow trout & shrimp. Meal comes with warm bread and butter. Oyster is a strongly recommend must have as they are fresh and comes with 3 different delicious sauces (& Tabasco also). Good service, good food, and pretty cozy restaurant. I haven't been here for a very, very long time!  Stopped in for a great dinner and it was better than when I was here before!!  I had the Chilean Sea Bass, best piece of fish I have ever had!  Well worth the price and my hats off to the chef!!!  We were about 45 minutes early for our reservation, but they still sat us in 15 minutes! Tge staff I spoke with were all awesome!\n\nYou need to try here! Our server Taylor was amazing, Our glasses were never empty he was on top of everything! The food was bombastic. The fried stuffed shrimp and crab are the best things here. But honestly, I never had anything bad from here. This is a great date spot if you're ballin $$$ or a wonderful family-friendly seafood experience. Both our server, Rhew, and the manager, Brett, were very accommodating regarding allergies of a member of our dining party - honestly, its was the most attentive I've ever experienced at any restaurant.   As always, all the dishes came out hot, delicious, and plentiful.\n\nThis is one of our favorite \"date night\" spots and we always have excellent service and never leave hungry.  A favorite is the octopus, calamari, artichoke heart platter appetizer. Break out your fat pants and buckle up for southern-sized seafood portion. Had the Louisiana Andouille Sausage & Seafood Gumbo which was loaded with seafood and Andouille. The smokiness of the Andouille was my favorite part of the gumbo, it gave it great depth without overpowering the other ingredients. Also got the Shrimp & Cajun Chicken Tenderloins, not sure what made the chicken tenderloins Cajun, but they were fine. The shrimp was fried and breaded in Panko breadcrumbs giving it a light and sweet taste. For my drink I got the Blood Orange Buck which was fantastically refreshing, not overly sweet and still got the twang of the blood orange. Lastly, for dessert I got the Cr\u00e8me Br\u00fbl\u00e9e. If you go for anything at Pappadeaux's get the dessert, the Cr\u00e8me Br\u00fbl\u00e9e came in a literal trough. The custard was perfectly cooked and the caramelized sugar was just the right layer of thickness. Best dessert I have had in awhile. Pappadeaux's prices are certainly on the higher side which is expected, due to it being a seafood restaurant in Colorado. Service was well-versed in the menu and made helpful suggestions. Food came out quickly and the place was packed. The noise level wasn't bad when my group first went in, but as it filled up more it started to get a little harder to hear those on the other side of the table. We got a reservation for our group, but honestly didn't need one as they had plenty of seating."

    "reviews": "This was the last dinner during my company-paid training trip to the area and was definitely a different experience.\n\nNot too often dining at a restaurant that's buffalo-themed and everyone enjoyed their bison burgers just as I enjoyed my bison filet.\n\nThis was the first time having a filet from buffalo, had a couple of bison burgers in my lifetime but never a steak which was exactly quite delicious.\n\nI'm visiting from the northern Chicago suburbs and I found out that we have one of these venues in the southwest Chicago suburbs so I'll definitely have to make the drive sometime after I get back home if I get that craving for bison.\n\nDefinitely a go-to spot if ever back in the area! Hope for continued boomin' business for decades to come for the owner(s). The staff was amazing. Food was good with a slight issue on my sides. This is where eh 4 stars came in - food.\n\nCharlie the host was super sweet and accommodating. I came first before the full party came. He was ready to take me to our table, but I asked to wait for them. He obliged and we struck a conversation of his favorite starters from Ted's.\n\nPedro was awesome, accommodating, and friendly.  He checked up on us at \"first bite, filled our drinks promptly, and all around amazing! I told him my broccoli tastes funny like fuel or propane. He was shocked as we were. Immediately, he offered to get me different sides, but I passed. He was apologetic and asked if I wanted to see the manager. I said, \"no, just let the chef know the broccoli tasted funny.\"\n\nThe food. We all went with a bison meal - meatloaf, brisket, and the ribeye. All around the  meat selections were fantastic. The downfall - the broccoli tasted like fuel or propane. I couldn't put my finger on why or how that was possible, but  it was a NO for me. The dessert was their homemade strawberry shortcake - shareable and delicious! Definitely recommend the meats and dessert, pass on that broccoli.\n\nThank you, Pedro and Charlie!!! I would recommend this location. Visited Ted's after visiting Uptown Circus next door. To be fair, a larggggge group was dining here at the same time. Our server was inattentive and distracted. She did recommend the bison nachos. Great recommendation.  We also ordered the fish sandwich and salmon.  The two fish sandwiches lacked flavor.  The salmon could have been prepared by Safeway's prepared food section.  The mashed potatoes are super boring and bland as Bobby Blue. The nachos were the highlight of the evening. Our server offered us a free dessert due to the lack of service provided to us. We selected the blueberry lemon cookie but left it at the restaurant.  It was not our cup of cookie. Perhaps it just wasn't a good evening for Ted. But it's kinda pricy not to enjoy 3 meals. Good American chain restaurant. The buffalo meatloaf is also available as a sandwich which is very tasty. The onion rings have a good onion to breading ratio and were not at all greasy. The half pickles are interesting and good.\n\nService was fast and efficient. My glass was never empty. There is password protected Wi-Fi. The space is a western theme and open enough to not feel crowded. The country western music is not really my thing, but did fit the restaurant.\n\nThere's lots of parking, but you may not be particularly close to the restaurant given its location. Had lunch at Ted\u2019s Montana Grill - place was really quiet, but food was good and service was excellent. Highly recommend the Bison burger (my favorite is the mushroom and Swiss), onion rings, and complimentary pickles. Sodas come with crushed bullet ice - excellent. Great option for high end burger. Wish there were more locations."

The family who owns and runs it is absolutely wonderful \u2014 welcoming, kind, and passionate about what they do.\n\nAnd the food? Incredible. Every dish we tried was bursting with authentic Greek flavors, made with so much care and attention to detail. You can tell this is the kind of place where recipes have been passed down and perfected over generations.\n\nIt\u2019s one of those rare spots that feels like home the second you sit down. I can\u2019t recommend it enough and will definitely be back again (and again!). If you haven\u2019t been to Yannis yet \u2014 you\u2019re missing out on something truly special. We were greeted with a shot of Ouzo which made us feel welcomed. Our waitress was very friendly and attentive as well. However, the food wasn\u2019t our favorite even though we absolutely love Greek cuisine. The lamb souvlaki was very dry and the meat in the gyro platter didn\u2019t taste good either. Delicious tzatziki sauce but we all agreed that they should invest in a better quality meats. Please don\u2019t waste your time in this place, staring with the food, is baaaad! And the service sooo bad and slow even the owner was there drinking with his friends and he didn\u2019t help us at all. Our party of 10 will not come back ever.  Ohh an sooo expensive for the quality of the food. Walked in for a late lunch and was immediately greeted with open arms and a warm, welcoming atmosphere. We ended up chatting with Yanni\u2014who we later found out is the owner\u2014and he couldn\u2019t have been kinder. He checked in on us, had a full conversation, and made us feel right at home. The food was absolutely delicious! I had the chicken lunch plate with salad and rice\u2014so flavorful and perfectly cooked. To top it off, Yanni brought out a complimentary dessert: yogurt with walnuts and honey. It was so good! All around, amazing food and even better people. Will definitely return Excellent food, amazing service and great atmosphere! I stopped in after a week long ski trip, as I was looking forward to having some traditional and authentic homestyle Greek food. Yanni's Greek Restaurant definitely hit all the spots. Food was delicious and was paired nicely with a glass of traditional \"Retsina\".\n\nThank you Yiannis and staff for an amazing dining experience and will see you again when I am back in Colorado!"

    "reviews": "It's nice to find a brewery that doesn't just have IPAs. The fact that it's also a restaurant that serves Indian food makes this especially notable. They had a good range of beers on tap (the chai stout was very good) and a good amount of dishes that went from more typical staples to less commonly seen. The samosas and garlic cheese naan were both great. The makhani was very good; I got it medium spicy and there was spice present but it didn't overpower the other flavors of the dish (it honestly could have been a little spicier). The staff were kind and helpful. Overall I had a wonderful experience and would definitely come back again. I chose this place solely based on their rotating season menus.  I am so happy I did.  I went here back in February.  The service was great as we got seated quickly even though the place was packed. They were doing a trivia night, which added to the fun.  They had a great beer selection as well.  I had the Poke, which was the best Poke I have ever had.  I am from the PNW and can not find Poke that good here.  I would highly recommend this dish.  I would also recommend the adult tater tots.  All in all, I would highly recommend this as a regular spot if you live in the area.  If you don't live but are passing through, make this a stop. Beer is really good \ud83d\udc4d\nScooter Gang/ scooter spa/ Mexican lager\nHaven\u2019t tried the food but, nice servers overall .  We went in on a Tuesday and, the website said they closed at 9:30 but they actually closed at 9. I don\u2019t think their hours are up to date. Also towards the end of the night it kind of starts smelling like sewerage around the bar area . Spice trade is not the same. We came here on a Sunday excited to have the our favorite food and beer\u2026instead we found the kitchen has changed to an Indian restaurant. Food was tolerable at best. Service was not great either. I spilled a water and the waitress just stood there smiling and didn\u2019t offer to get napkins. Beer took forever. So weird. Do not recommend coming here and we will not be back. Spice Trade used to be our favorite spot in Denver and we would come here weekly. The food, service, and beers were phenomenal. Unfortunately, even though it is still under the same name and same ownership, it is no longer the same restaurant. The original staff whom we loved has been replaced entirely and the service now is TERRIBLE. Our first time going was a few months ago, and we couldn\u2019t get anyone to take our order, and it felt more like a restaurant than a place that we could go just for a beer. It felt like it was a hassle that we were even there. Giving them the benefit of the doubt, we recently decided to give it another shot, and unfortunately the experience was very similar and not worth the money. The menu has moved from patio munchies to Indian food, which feels more than a formal restaurant than after work/ summer hang. Some of the beers are the same but nothing else is. It has one of our favorite beers we\u2019ve ever had, but it genuinely pains me to say that we won\u2019t be going back, and we\u2019ve got several friends who have now said the same."

    "reviews": "Cute local burrito joint that offers good quality food. I ordered the chicken nachos. It came in a large portion with deliciously fresh ingredients. They had a bar and lots of indoor seating. The employees were so kind and helpful! The atmosphere is very nice and it was actually really clean. The food was okay -- our queso was just so watery. The chips had no salt on them, too. Finally, the bartender made it so obvious he was upset for not getting a tip for pouring a drink while I'm standing right there. Pretty ridiculous, and why I rated the service 3. All other employees were super professional. Seriously, this bowl serving size is the best you could do?  Where is the rice, where is the double meat.  Order through door dash, around 4:18 pm  on 1/14/24 order corfirmed. Who prepped it??  Ridiculous.  Find who prepped such a small serving. Went at 6:40pm on a Wednesday. Every table either had crumbs, trash or was sticky. Or all 3. This is not an exaggeration. Zero were clean. Out of 20 empty tables. I used paper towels and the water machine to clean my own table because staff were slammed and stressed. The staff were nice but obviously overworked.\n\nFloor had food and crumbs everywhere. Just everywhere worse than an elementary school lunch room.\n\nPork green chili was good. Chicken quesidilla was gross and I tossed it. My kids who usually eat any garbage threw most of their burritos away.\n\nI won't go back. One and done.\n\nOn the way there I was telling my kids how Illegal Pete's downtown is a staple of Denver that I first went to 20 years ago. The owners of this DTC location should be embarrassed and ashamed of themselves and should not be allowed to use the Illegal Pete's name.\n\nI spent $50 on garbage. Oh and the horchata machine was broken so had to have Mountain Dew which I also threw away since it was over diluted or maybe needed changing but I bought a drink from the gas station right afterwards.\n\nI literally feel like they stole $50 plus tip from me. Rock bottom experience. We enjoyed the Mexican food at Illegal Pete\u2019s. The Baja Fish tacos and bowls were very good and something that differentiates this restaurant from other restaurants such as Chipotle or Qdoba. The value of the dishes were also pretty good for the price. We will be back again."

Went here to celebrate my birthday and it was a lovely and very chill atmosphere. It was a bit dim inside with the moody lighting. The server was attentive but not too hover-y and it wasn\u2019t too difficult to have a conversation with my date even though it was a full restaurant. The food was delicious! Had a great meal at Del Frisco\u2019s!! Food was delicious!! Had Meatballs for starter, lobster tail with my steak and a side of crab meat macaroni!! The macaroni is A MUST TRY!! Will definitely be back!! I had the pleasure of being served by Doug during a special Mother\u2019s Day dinner with my family\u2014a party of 11. Even though the restaurant was extremely busy, Doug handled everything with calm professionalism and an amazing attitude. He was attentive, organized, and made us feel truly valued throughout the entire evening. Despite the holiday rush, the service was smooth and the experience was incredible. Doug went above and beyond, and it\u2019s clear he takes great pride in his work. Truly outstanding service! What an incredible experience at the Double Eagle! It's truly a top-tier steak place that stands unmatched. I savored the best filet mignon I've ever had, and it brought a smile to my face with every delicious bite. The style and atmosphere are just perfect\u2014there's really no other place like it! If you're after a joyful dining experience, this is the spot to be!"

The atmosphere of the restaurant was very nice. They had plenty of parking and it was easy finding the restaurant.\nOverall,  we had a pleasant dining experience My husband and I celebrated our anniversary here and had a fantastic time! Although we didn\u2019t make a reservation and were initially unsure if this was the right choice, the quality and taste of the food quickly won us over. Everything was delicious, and we were especially impressed by the Drunken Coconut Pie\u2014a delightful dessert that\u2019s not overly sweet, crustless, and packed with fresh shredded coconut, served with a rich rum caramel sauce.\n\nBeyond the amazing food, the atmosphere was warm and inviting. The cozy setting, which wasn\u2019t overcrowded, allowed us to enjoy a pleasant conversation without feeling rushed or overwhelmed. The service was exceptional, with friendly and attentive staff, from the servers to the front counter employees, making our experience even more enjoyable.\n\nHighly recommend this place for a memorable and relaxing dining experience! I was pleasantly surprised overall! The steak and crab cake was spot on and cooked perfectly. The ambiance inside\u2026 is like a small step above village inn. Tables are very close to each other. Service was fine but had to ask for the complimentary bread that everyone had except us. Asked for bacon on the side of the soup and they just didn\u2019t include it. So small things like that but overall it was pretty tasty and quick. Would come back! My girlfriend and I come here all the time. The menu is always changing,  so it's nice to have new options. The bar area is a great place to get a quick table. Kenzie and Diego are our normal server's here and they always do a great job on dinner service. Our second time here in the past few months. We had a celebration dinner for my kids and their graduations. This visit we had 13 people ranging from ages 11 to over 60. They had a variety of options to choose from and we're very accommodating and organized with such a large party. Everyone was served their dish, no guessing or going what did I order again or passing plates around the table. They knew right where everything went. I wish I could remember our servers name but I don't. Amazing job and especially with the youngest and a little moment of indecision, when he realized the bang bang shrimp tacos and wanted to switch his order. Not a hint of frustration or anything negative he was all positive with him, which made his night."

    "reviews": "Ya Yas bistro is a great little gem in the heart of centennial / DTC.\nIt offers quality ingredients with upscale menu items.  It's not the most expensive meal but isn't casual dining. The atmosphere is a modern elevated look with a touch of classy old world vibes.  The service is always wonderful and their menu is sure to delight. Went out for a corporate dinner. Atmosphere was drab, the best part of the experience was the host and wait-staff, they were wonderful. The appetizers were good but other than that, food was meh (not much options for vegetarian). Sunday brunch is highly recommended. Had steak and eggs and it came out cooked exactly as ordered. Friendly service and good value for the price Held a rehearsal dinner for over 40 people in the back private dining area. Coordinated with Rachel ahead of time on the menu choices for guests. The appetizers, entrees, and desserts were great, as was the service. Especially loved the surf and turf! Highly recommend for a large group event. The location of the restaurant is great: convenient and easy to get to, which was a promising start. Inside, the ambiance is lovely with a cozy, inviting atmosphere that feels well thought-out and cared for.\n\nThe menu overall is pretty good, offering a decent variety, though it misses some simple staples. The calamari appetizer was especially disappointing\u2014it arrived as one big clump, with a heavy taste of old, burnt oil and an overwhelming amount of fried flour bits. Honestly, it was the worst calamari I\u2019ve ever had.\n\nMy angel hair pasta was more than half tomatoes, which overwhelmed the dish. I requested no steak sauce on my filet, but it came sitting in a pool of it\u2014underneath the filet and even on top of some bland mashed potatoes.\n\nOn a positive note, the restrooms were clean. There\u2019s potential here, especially with the location and interior, but the kitchen execution and attention to detail need some serious improvement."

    "reviews": "Really craving a smash burger.  Decided to come in and try Bad Daddy\u2019s at Southlands.  My husbands fried chicken salad was very good for him.  Lots of crispy tender chicken on a good size bowl of mixed greens.  I ordered the double smash burger with high hopes.  The first burger was dry and cold when I got it.  I requested mayo and after more than 5 mins waiting for our server I had to flag another server down who had it back to me in 30 seconds. By then my burger was really cold and not enjoyable at all. I asked for it to be remade. The tots and dipping sauce were excellent. We waited over 20 minutes for our food so I was worried the remake would take too long but somehow we had that in 5 minutes.  Much better!  Juicy, warm and they brought the mayo out with the burger. It\u2019s a solid 4 star burger.  All the servers were extremely friendly and helpful but I was confused by how long the original order took.\nOverall the decor is fun and plenty of seating - it\u2019s just dark. No What a fun time we had at bad daddy\u2019s! The food was good and perfectly portion. Our waitress Christina was so sweet and was so attentive to us! She was so great! We had the $2 margaritas for the event on 2/22 it was so much fun! We had such a great time and it made our day.  The margaritas were good. Not too strong and not too sweet perfect mixed. Food came out hot and perfectly seasoned! Awesome Burgers and Sweet Potato Fries!\n\nThis place is my go-to for build-your-own burgers! I always get the burger with fried chicken and fried mozzarella cheese\u2014it's seriously the best combo. And the sweet potato fries? I order them every single time; they\u2019re so good!\n\nThe vibe here is perfect whether you\u2019re with a big group or just a few friends. The service is great too\u2014super friendly and fast. Definitely recommend if you\u2019re looking for a fun spot with tasty food! Was here mother's day with my girl and the kiddo. We were sat next to a table with some people who had probably drank to much. The table was very rude and just swearing a bunch talking about very inappropriate stuff incredibly loud and around several tables with children seated in that area. Instead of confronting the table myself i figured the staff would probably be a little more tactful than I would about the situation. I gotta give it to them, they handled things perfectly. They moved our table inside, investigated the table that had the complaints (at this point other guests had complained as well), and politely had the table wrap things up and cash out and be on their way. They even comped our kiddos burger and got her a milkshake too. We totally weren't expecting that so that was a pleasant surprise we just were hoping to figure out a solution where our family could eat a burger without having to listen to this table make up blatant lies about how much tail he pulls. Worth adding, the table was a couple of dorks and their poor mother was likely incredibly embarrassed by her boys behavior and language is the impression I got. That's neither here nor there though. Anyway I don't remember all the staff names that helped out except John the bartender was a stud and got the situation handled very quickly and professionally. Shout out John. Give that man a raise. Our server was Riley and she was incredible! She offered us some beer tasters and even recommended a couple based on what we asked to try.\n\nShe recommended the fried deviled eggs, which were fantastic, then offered recommendations on my custom burger based on what I was adding to it.\n\nHighly recommend and hope you get Riley, too!"

Thx for the attention and improved food and experience.\n\nReally poor service. We were sitting at the bar and literally had to stand up and wave arms to try and order food. Still didn\u2019t get the bartenders attention, so resorted to stopping a passing waitress and ask for service. The cheese curds were excellent, but the wings\u2026tough and dry. The atmosphere is nice and the robot servers are fun, but we won\u2019t be back. I don't know why they don't sauce their wings. I don't know why service is so slow. I don't know why it smells like sewage in the restaurant. I like Buffalo Wild Wings. I really don't like this location. Takes an hour to get food since covid. To go orders are ready half an hour or more after they're supposed to be and it's lukewarm at best. They gave us ROTTEN celery.  They're stingy with their sauce. Unfortunately, I think I'm done with location. Bad experience ever, food was really dry and over cooked and when we talked with Jordan the \u201cmanager\u201d she said it was because it had a lot of time on the table one thing is cold and another is overcooked you can\u2019t even bite them. We were talking with the \u201cmanager\u201d and we didn\u2019t even finish talking, she just walked away laughing. I didn\u2019t want anything free I just wanted them to redo it to eat them because thats what someone pays for, for good food but the food I received was dry and overall bad. Came here about a week or so ago didn\u2019t take to long to get seated which was the only good part of this experience, got my drinks no issue there, the issues began when we placed our order before another table that was right next to me and they still got their food first, table next to us got pretty much the same thing waited for over half an hour for the waiter to check on us it wasn\u2019t after an hour of waiting with no food or waiter checking in that I just left cash for the drinks and left. Looking at the reviews for this location a lot of people seem to have the same issue an issue some people had that I didn\u2019t because I never got my food was apparently feathers ? Honestly the worst location for a Buffalo Wild Wings of all time. I'm so disappointed.  This will be a location I never visit again.  Slow service! Cold wings! The waitress will drop off food and walk away without asking you if you need anything else. The wifes salad was half bad lettuce, too.  She won't come and check on you.  At one point, I got up and walked to the bar to pay the bill because she was missing, but only to see that there were only 2 other employees around and they didn't care what I was doing.  Once the robot brings food out, they act like their job is done.  I will never come here again."

Different from British fish and chips.\n\nI had a daily special bulgogi burger. Great fusion of tastes, worth trying!\n\nThe other dishes our party ordered looked amazing. Very good presentation.\n\nThe seasoned fries were good.\n\nEntree sizes were small for the price. I had to fill up on fries, the entree did not.\n\nThe bar was full and the bartender was working hard to fill nonstop orders.\n\nService was fine, no complaints.\n\n5 stars for the Alaska decor. Fun!\n\nMy only gripe is $/serving sizes, but the taste was excellent.\n\nIt's a small pub. Get there early. It filled fast. This is a cool spot to get a meal with an Alaskan theme. They have a bunch of nice options on the food and drinks menu - the knik burger and the beef burgundy were decent. They have happy hour specials so we tried some wings - they were also decent. We'd come back here again for sure.\n\nParking is easy - there's a free lot. I've never seen an Alaskan restaurant before, so I was immediately intrigued by this spot.\n\nWe arrived just before 3 on a Saturday and I was surprised how busy it was. We got the only available table and it remained busy until we left.\n\nMy husband and I shared:\n- Fried Calamari (special)\n- Alcan Poutine Burger\n- Prosciutto in a Pear Tree Burger (special)\n\nThey're busy for a reason - the food is delicious! I absolutely loved the citrus sauce on the calamari. Between the burgers, I preferred the poutine burger because it was saucier.\n\nWe ordered our burgers medium and they came medium well which was a bit disappointing, but they were still delicious. We met friends for dinner, every dish was amazing! The Brussels with bacon and Poppers were the perfect starters. Then the Barrow Beef Burgundy brought it home. Hannah was awesome and treated us like friends after just meeting us. We will be back! We happened to be visiting in Denver a couple of days ago and decided to try this place out. It was surprisingly good. My wife had the bison burger special and I had the elk meatloaf. Both were excellent choices. I especially liked the elk meatloaf and mashed potatoes. They gladly switched out the green beans for some raw vegetables. The fries that came with the bison burger were also very good The food was delicious, the service was very good, and there was no wait at all. I will definitely plan to return here the next time I happen to be visiting Denver."

    "reviews": "The two women working this morning are gems! Thank you so much for making my daughter feel extra special today for her birthday! Quick service, super friendly and helpful. Ordered an iced coffee with less ice. Had to wait about 5 minutes for it to be made, no problem. But when it was handed to me I told the girl that I had ordered it with less ice and she told me it was with less ice\u2026. It absolutely wasn\u2019t.  This location never gets the order right. $13 for a wake up wrap and a large coffee\u2026 what is this place. These prices have me not eating out and the franchise owners and cooperations can blame theirselves on greediness. Wow, what an amazing and uplifting experience at this DD today! I am surprised by all the negative reviews (unless leadership / mgmt has since changed). Friendly, fast, efficient, clean, and excellent customer service. I went to redeem my free birthday drink, and I was greeted with such kindness and generosity! They wished me multiple happy birthdays from numerous staff members working today. Patrick even offered a surprise free birthday treat of my choice! The staff today was professional, kind, and showed me A++ customer service. Big smiles from all, well wishes of a happy birthday, and with the unexpected generosity, this absolutely made my day. Patrick is clearly doing an exceptional job, and he is an asset to DD at large! Give Patrick a raise and / or an award! I am disappointed I am visiting from out of state; otherwise, if I lived closer, this would definitely become my regular DD. Thank you, Patrick, and the rest of the staff working today at this DD! You brightened my day, and I am so grateful for the unexpected personalized generosity! Keep it up; the world needs more human beings like you! :-) I asked for a large vanilla cappuccino and they brought me this monstrosity. I was dumbfounded. So, I will now share what the definition of a cappuccino is. \u201cCappuccino is an espresso-based coffee drink that is traditionally prepared with steamed milk including a layer of milk foam.\u201d"

    "reviews": "This is a great place! Just know that the entrance is to the left of the main entrance as you are pulling into the hotel's parking lots. After you go in the rotating doors, the restaurant is straight ahead and slightly left.\n\nI'm at a friend here for lunch and she had one of the burgers what she said was really good but slightly undercooked. I had the bowl of green chili which was a great portion and not too much. It was super delicious and they said it was their best seller.\n\nIf you are a root beer lover like me, just know that they either have cans of Shasta root beer or Mug root beer on tap.\n\nThey have a great selection of rotating beers. And the lighting is amazing then. There's lots of natural lighting. There's lots of open space as well. It wasn't very crowded there and I'd say it was maybe 15% full during lunch. This made it very quiet and easy to have good conversations. I did not expect much from this hotel restaurant, but I was happily surprised. The fare is consistent and not heavy. The dining room and bar is spacious, inviting, bright and clean. We were served by Candace two nights in a row., she was attentive, friendly and hard working. Easily one of the best servers I have experienced. Delicious food and great service! I was here for Colorado anime fest and got too hungry so I stopped here to eat. The bulgogi was great! This restaurant is amazing! The breakfast fried rice and a chorizo potato bowl are so goood! Love love love! Breakfast and dinner! Highly recommend this restaurant. It's beautiful, comfy, perfect for any occasion...  Date, work, family vacation, or just because, I just love it. We stayed in the Marriott on vacation and this restaurant couldn't have been better being on the Lobby Level. We had the same waitress every morning and she was absolutely wonderful! Mike was bartending when we made our dinner to go order and he was great as well! Prices are perfect for the amount and quality of food! Highly recommend the 3-egg meal! ;)"

Our waitress, Trinity, went above and beyond in her recommendations, and each one was a hit with my boyfriend and I. Her amazing service and enthusiastic personality put Darcy's at the top of our list of places to eat next time we visit Colorado! Ordered through foodsby. Absolutely not good. Mexican meatloaf was petrified; wilted lettuce; portions not according to the price. Definitely will not order again. Amazing pub next to the Hampton Inn. I visited three times while on a business trip. The staff are knowledgeable about beer and food menus. The food is delicious. The first day, I had the Darcey burger with fries with and old-fashioned. Day two, I went for the more traditional Bangers and Mash with a next beer chosen by the bartender. Day three was the Buffalo wings and Parmesan garlic wings. The curry French fries stile the show. The menu is loaded, you can't miss. I was here to see my friends band headline the music portion of their St Patrick's weekend celebration. I'm sure their service is awesome most other days, but they were slammed that night and didn't have an extra bar set up outside.\n\nOtherwise, everything was top notch all the way! Great staff, security and an excellent heated tent set up for live music outside on a cold blustery weekend.\n\nLooking forward to checking them out another time and trying their menu. I've heard good things! Service, great and cute. Vibe, fun and welcoming. Food, made me stop in my tracks it was so amazing."

Safe to say his excellence made me say \u201cwe\u2019re never going to Hampden again\u201d after today. Service is rare these days, Jalen disproved that today. Most delicious food ever.\nIm so glad they had the shrimp here because they never have it at my location.\nAlso give Isaiah a raise or something because he was very thoughtful and courteous. excellent customer service like no other It's 4:30 on a Sunday afternoon and decided to pop in for an early dinner.\nThe place was empty.\nBut it was spotless, and I was greeted enthusiastically by the young gentleman behind the counter.  He was pleasant and so nice to talk to.  I feel bad I didn't get his name.\nAnd the food was fresh and tasty.\n\nI give this location 10 Stars!!   \ud83c\udf1f"

The flavors, aromas, and presentations were all 10/10. Cannot wait to come back here and try more! Love this place. Go to place for sushi whenever we want to have. I love everything about their menu options and varieties of rolls. Even for a vegetarian, this place has plenty of good options. On arrival, we were seated at the sushi bar, where we were warmly welcomed by our server, Ceraira, and sushi chef, Hector. Ceraira provided exceptional service\u2014friendly, attentive, and accommodating. Hector\u2019s sushi presentation was stunning, showcasing his skill and creativity.\n\nThe food was incredibly flavorful and the best sushi I\u2019ve ever had. I also appreciated that they offered gluten-free options, making the experience even better. Every bite was fresh, delicious, and beautifully prepared. Highly recommend this place for both the food and the outstanding service! -Vega Approved \u2714\ufe0f\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffc Brenna was amazing! She had great recommendations and was one of the best servers I\u2019ve had in a long time! The food was amazing as well and the closest Hawaiian food I\u2019ve been able to fine in Colorado. Great place!! The Chirashi bowl was incredible along with their signature rolls!! The service was unmatched and amazing by our server Ceraira. Such a sweetheart and really cares about your experience with everything. Ask for her!"

I know that you know that this store is great.  I love the stories of you two supporting your employees, thank you!\n\nWe come to this location because of your people.  Canada, Alayah, and more so, the BossLady herself, Renee.  What a kind, gracious, funny, welcoming, confident, genuine, professional, caring person (to the public, yes, but also her workers).  We were drawn to her from day ONE.\n\nMy friend is pretty severely vision impaired.  We\u2019ve built a such relationship with Renee that when she sees us pass the drive thru window she tells the crew, \u201cMy girls are here, I\u2019ll be back\u201d, then comes to hold open the door for us!  We are greeted with a big ol\u2019 smile, and a hug.\n\nThe restaurant is clean, the food is good (& served hot!), but we come for the service, and heart of the leader here.  Give her gold stars, or kudos, or money, or all of those things, but she\u2019s deserving of being rewarded.   You are very fortunate to have someone like Renee represent Wendy\u2019s & you to your customers Just ordered the crispy chicken sandwich meal. The chicken sandwich was nice and hot tasted very fresh it was delicious the fries on the other hand not so much. The young gentleman at the counter was more than helpful as I ordered my food even gave some suggestions on what I should get, I very much appreciated that as I can be indecisive. Would have been 5 stars if not for the fries but other than that I was satisfied with my visit. My colleagues and i came in for a quick bite the other night. The workers are so kind! They even gave us a couple free drinks. Double check your meat before you eat.\n\nService was good. The person working the window was very friendly. The fries were very fresh and tasty but my burger was still raw in the middle. I only had French fries for dinner because it's not worth driving there again. I imagine food poisoning might be an issue if they aren't cooking the meat all of the way through.\n\nDisappointed."

Did the Bloody Mary bar for brunch and it was fantastic.  A great selection to assemble your drink.  The food was hardy and was great on a Saturday morning.  We arrived shortly after open and the service was extremely quick.  Even after about an hour and a half there it wasn't too busy and service was quick. Our server Jacob was great!  The service was amazing bad the food was pretty good.  They were out of the meatloaf but I am excited to try it again during the next visit.  They had a very good happy hour as well and a long one on Friday.  Great place if you have to go out in the tech center. Well I had the Salmon served on sweet potato mash and spinach and I died and went to heaven! Waiter was great. I feel the Salmon was worth the price. It was delicious! This was my first time coming here. Definitely would recommend this dish. Ordered through Grubhub. Salad was supposed to be topped with avocado, tomatoes, crispy tortilla strips, and beans. Not sure what happened to them??"

    "reviews": "Awesome Irish spot! Came thru on a Saturday night.. Packed but good vibes... Stopped by St Patrick's Day and the waitress Laura was great... Got the chicken tenders with Cajun dry rub she buffalo sauce. This neighborhood bar is definitely a fun spot. Pool tables, darts, live music, bingo. Good place for big groups! My only complaint is that there is no drink menu. That makes it really hard to predict what the tab will look like at the end of the night. We had a great time on Monday night.  They had Forbidden BINGO night with some great drink specials and the DJ/Host gave out some amazing fun \"forbidden\" prizes for those who won bingo.  Bingo was free and well worth the time.  Food was delicious. Service did a great job, especially with how busy it was.  Would highly recommend a Monday night out! I recently moved to Aurora from Texas and work at Buckley Space Force Base. I don\u2019t get out too much, but I\u2019m glad I found The Angry Clove!\n\nI sat at the bar, and the service was excellent\u2014the bartender was attentive, friendly, and we even discovered we\u2019re both fans of the same baseball team\u2014the Boston Red Sox. That night, I did not try the food so I am not able to give it a review, but I\u2019m definitely saving that for my next visit.\n\nThe atmosphere was great, and they had a live band playing a variety of music genres. While sititng at the bar, I also had the pleasure of meeting one of their amazing waitresses, Laura. She was sweet, kind, friendly, and very beautiful and I truly enjoyed our conversation.\n\nI\u2019m glad I decided to check out The Angry Clove, and I\u2019m looking forward to coming back soon! Came tonight at 1040. Opened the door and blonde lady behind the bar immediately screamed across the bar and said she's done and closed.  The time online says midnight. My husband and I just wanted to have a quick drink. She was rude. Normally I enjoy stopping here but I will not come back."

This place is a perfect getaway spot for you to relax while enjoying a drink along with great food.  Although the menu is very limited, its simple variety of selections is enough to satisfy regularly returning customers. The best part is the service from beginning to end. Love this place before new owners. It's where I met my forever. Went tonight and was served one drink and forgot about for 20 mins. Planned to order food but decided to leave. Went there to shoot pool but no pool tables anymore. Good bye"

    "reviews": "I made an online order earlier in the day. When I went to pick it up, my car wouldn\u2019t start. It took me two hours to eventually go pick up my order. The team at this Dunkin were so nice about remaking my order so it was hot and fresh. 10/10 customer service, turned my crappy day around to a good day. Thank you guys so much! The only Dunkin donut I like is vanilla cr\u00e8me filled . At 11:30 on a Saturday morning, they have no vanilla cr\u00e8me filled donuts. You sell donuts! You should have all your donuts!! Also, I\u2019ve been to other Dunkin Donut locations and their crime filled are actually filled outside the donut with a nice swirl of cr\u00e8me. Lucky to get a teaspoon of cr\u00e8me in the donut at this location. Do better cuz you suck! Decided to get goodies this a.m. with my elderly dad. Ordered through the app and picked up in the drive through.  Hesitant to come as last visit the donuts were slapped together frosting to frosting. We ordered 4 donuts, free munchkins and 2 lattes. The free item was perfect as the munchkins were in a box. The donuts were once again slapped together and the skim, no whip mocha had whip - corrected at the drive through window. I don't know if there is a lack of training or just complacency, but I won't visit this location again.  My dad wouldn't touch the donuts because the were such a jumbled mess. this place is nice,  i come pretty often. But i kinda wished that they would finish processing the order before making it.  I literally made them make 5 drinks to only get 1. I felt super bad, so they should make the drinks after the people pay to avoid this \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d I went in to get the refresher drink, which was three dollars the other day the girl proceeds to ring me up for a small and charge me 469 for the drink. When I told her it should be three dollars she refused to give me a refund for the difference.\n\nSpoke to the manager of the store too named Jeremy and he was rude and refused to resolve the situation."

I went in on my birthday...had spent loads of money there..brought a friend..we spent over $40 in drink and they then informed me they do not give free drink on birthday. .if your not an old man drunk I'd avoid this pub.

Definitely recommend this spot for anyone looking for a good breakfast burrito. They have a wrap around bar and a pool table with a pretty good drink selection.

    "reviews": "Typical neighborhood sports bar featuring many screens and a couple of pool tables. The menu is good for a sports bar; the patty melt on toasted rye bread was very good with grilled onion. It was just the right size for lunch for me. Several other menu items were interesting including a reuben sandwich. There is a soup of the day which appeared to be available in a bowl size. A cup would be nice if you're also getting a sandwich and a side.\n\nService was excellent. It was fast, friendly and attentive. The space is a little dark in the bar area, but that makes the screens easier to see. There are enough screens to cover all or most of the games at a given time. Wi-Fi is available.\n\nThere is plenty of parking available in the lot. I recently visited for the first time after living nearby for three years, and I can\u2019t believe I waited so long! The energy in the place is electric, with fans cheering for their teams and a vibrant atmosphere that makes you feel right at home. The decor is sports-themed and adds to the excitement, making it a perfect spot to catch a game.\n\nThe staff was incredibly friendly and attentive, ensuring we had everything we needed. The menu offers a great selection of classic bar bites. They also have pool tables!\n\nOverall, I had a fantastic experience and can\u2019t wait to come back for another game day! Had a very nice afternoon watching preseason football and baseball.  Drinks were fast and cold and service was friendly.  Comfortable atmosphere and menu is typical bar food. We stopped in after a conference with friends...because The 'Dam' Grille...was a great place. Folks were playing Backgammon and that had some intense moments...the staff were awesome and as far as food and drink...the bacon wrapped jalape\u00f1o and apricot blonde was an amazing pairing... Awesome place to watch the almighty Vikings kick ass! The food is just okay, typical bar food, but fills the void. The drinks are great, and the service is amazing. Amazing fanfare when the Vikings score, with the fight song, antler horn and drumming \ud83d\ude01\ud83d\ude1b A must have if you root for the Vikings. Skol! \ud83d\ude01\ud83e\udd70\ud83e\udd17"

We were thrilled to discover The Pub at Pelican Bay located on the lake; the boathouse bar and chill vibe was exactly what we needed. As soon as we sat down, we were immediately welcomed by the friendly staff and were made to feel like we've been friends forever. We ended up enjoying the afternoon talking with the other patrons and laughing with the bartenders (Sammy was awesome). The cocktails were made perfectly and the sliders were delicious! We are excited that they will be having live bands this Summer and look forward to our next visit; highly recommend!! No experience because the website says open and so does Google maps but they actually don't  open up until late may. 3 stars purely for the venue space. Great place to see live music but for the love of god eat before you come and bring your own lawn chairs. The food is awful and overpriced and there's very limited seating.\n\nREAD THIS REVIEW so you save yourself from what I didn't know!"

The reason for the 4 stars and not 5 is because it took so long to sign the waivers and got out on the water an hour late. If you go and haven't signed the waiver I recommend going at least 30-45 minutes early. I wish I would have known. Other than that it was fun and beautiful! Jake was awesome and even helped us in the middle of our trip on the water. Neat experience and would definitely go again. Wonderful! Cold Beer great view. Sandy Beach to sit with their  lawn chairs. You can't get any closer to the water. Brand new Pub with cold beer! Another wonderful concert at Pelican Bay!! The featured artists included my great friend, Tony Trahan in the Steely Dan tribute band, Citizen Dan \ud83d\ude00 I feel like I've just been let in on a secret. \u26f5\nIt's so peaceful and refreshing to my soul to be out on the water.\n\nThere is a fun band playing at the marina right now too!\nSomeone told me they have concerts every Thurs evening (I assume weather permitting). Love this place. I only wish Sloans Lake was as valued as this amenity. Fabulous job of providing a nautical experience with very limited resources that we have in Colorado.\n\nSloanslakeparkfoundation.org"

    "reviews": "Came to the place feeling a bit under the weather, so I needed the energy broth to help me get better. Cozy nice place and location. I ordered the medium pho with rare steak, and the portions of steak and noodles were very generous.\n\nAs a fellow reviewer mentioned earlier, a little bit on the light side for the broth but nonetheless delicious and a winner in my book. We go to this place a lot and it is usually really good but they came out with the food and we waited for a while but the meat was still raw. I came in about two weeks ago. It took a while to get seated. The pho was pretty good but I\u2019ve had better. The crab cheese wontons were nice and crispy but there is an extreme amount of cream cheese. Service was also not that great. It\u2019s overall not a terrible place but I don\u2019t know if I\u2019d go back. Ordered take out pho and spring roles. First the shrimp spring roles were just rice noodles, shrimp, and ice burg lettuce? Maybe I\u2019m mistaken but everywhere I\u2019ve received spring rolls usually at least has some herbs, carrot etc. it was not very good. The chicken pho was like rotisserie chicken, not grilled, no flavor. I used to come here and thought it was good from what I remember but this experience was not very good. Absolutely fantastic pho! The broth was rich and flavorful, with the perfect balance of spices. The meat was tender, and the fresh herbs made every bite even better. The service was quick and friendly. I\u2019ll definitely be coming back!"

    "reviews": "I breakfasted this morning at the Innsider, the house restaurant at the Holiday Inn Denver Lakewood .\nA solid offering, hotel breakfasts are never a sure thing, and this one was pretty darn good.\nThere were three of us at table this morning, enjoying three quite different offerings.\nDish #1 was the Malted Mini Waffles, served with mixed berries, whipped cream, and warm syrup.\nThe plating was quite attractive and also flavorful. The berries were fresh, the whipped cream rich, and the waffles had that lovely, malty flavor, which can frequently be mysteriously missing in some \"malted\" waffles.\nDish #2 was their Morning Breakfast Burrito. Made with two scrambled eggs, onion, peppers, bacon, crisp potatoes, and shredded cheese. It was served with both red and green salsa and was delicious enough to be consumed in mere moments (it seemed). I am providing a close-up to show the nicely balanced mix of ingredients.\nThe final dish on the table was the Breakfast Bowl, containing scrambled eggs, cheddar jack cheese, and one's choice of meat (the usual brekkie trio of either bacon, ham or sausage).\nThis was my dish, and I chose sausage. It was yummy, comforting, and filling, yet only contributing 425 calories to the daily total. I quite commonly enjoy (and review) the big skillet/shipwreck or luxurious omelet, but during this action-packed foray into the mountains, the lighter breakfast served me well.\nIt was by no means skimpy. The bowl was ample, and as it turns out, it powered me thru a day in which lunch didn't happen until 4:30.\nThe restaurant itself was clean and well run and possessed a full bar. It is also located directly in the hotel itself, which is a blessing to the weary traveler.\nI often choose not to eat at the house restaurant, desiring somewhere a bit more adventuresome to dine, but I enjoyed my experience at the Innsider and would recommend it for guests weary or otherwise.\n@RickiGoesOut Everything I've ordered during my extended stay at the hotel has been great. The service has been awesome as well. So convenient! I figured I get some wings after a long day and relax. Little do I know they only give you 6 wings for $15. Initially I figured at least 10 wings for that but what ever. You get to the fries, imagine those 4 day old McDonalds fries and you toss them in the microwave and they are still cold but a little warm on the edges yeah about like that. Needless to say don\u2019t count on the wings and fries after a long day. Waitress was amazing. The food was sub par. It wasn't anything special by any means and it was expensive for the quality. The place was attached to our hotel so it made it easy. Their hours are ridiculous though! How can you be a bar and close at 9? The staff here was so great! The atmosphere is nice and food is good. Travis had to serve the whole restaurant one morning because most of the staff was snowed in. He hustled and had the best attitude. We felt so taken care of! Highly recommend!!"

    "reviews": "Came here to try out Rocky mountain oysters for the first time. Since it's my first time trying them I cant personally judge how good they are but they were good and came with a good amount of fries. The burgers were crazy good. Asked for medium and got the most perfectly medium burger I ever had. The coleslaw was only cabbage and a bit too sweet but flavorful. The chili with the burger tasted canned but still was a nice addition. I've been here several times over the last few months.  The atmosphere and the food are good. Drink service is relatively fast. Twice, now, I've ordered food and followed up after a reasonable amount of time only to find that the order was never turned in.  It's unacceptable.   Further, even after a forgotten order is turned in, it appears it still lands at the bottom of the queue.  Food ticket time for one member of our group yesterday was over an hour. I HAD THE BEST PHILLY CHEESSTEAK HERE!!\nKrystal was the bartender and my server.  It's Saturday night, and she is the glue that holds this all together. Conscientious and didn't miss a beat. Woman deserves a raise. Wow! I\u2019ve driven by that green awning a million times and never went in. Love the old school bar vibes and the separate bars for watching tv or listening to a band. Really extensive menu and a lot of great choices from burgers to salads. Awesome house made chips! Super friendly bar tenders and great service. The food was plus for a \u201cbar\u201d and there was a great atmosphere with the sports and people chatting about. Clean restrooms and super fun! Great bar experience overall! Excellent drink selection, food was great, didn't have to wait long for it to be hot and ready and an excellent value for what you pay! Will definitely be back in the near future for some live music!"

    "reviews": "The food is good bar food. It's a bar first. I order quite often.\nOn Friday and Saturday night. The Bartenders are flying. The whole crew is working in sync.\nThey also have a variety of live bands on those nights.\nI have been there on several Friday and Saturday nights. This is a fun place they have a lot of pool tables and dart boards with pinball on Friday and Saturday nights they get some great live bands but get there early as the tables and dance floor fill up quickly Absolutely love Greenfields! Moved right next door and was looking for my go-to place. Great prices and happy hour. Hands down the best wings I've had. The staff recognizes us, because my partner and I go probably too much! Never disappointed! My friends and I have tried just about everything on the menu and not once have we not liked what we've ordered. From the cob salad, to the burgers, the quesadillas, and the pizza with the crust made from scratch. Everything has always been amazing. Different crowds of people during all times of the day. Great pool players, free pool on Wednesday, excellent diamond tables that are well maintained. The staff is consistent because they all work great together. I recommend stopping in for a cold beer and enjoying the large covered patio or shooting a game of pool in the back. Live music, poker, bingo, etc on other week nights. Check out the website. It's always up to date. If you're lucky, Dixie might tell you one of her jokes \ud83d\ude06 Food is amazing and I love this Spot.  Unfortunately tonight a waiter with dreads not sure her name decided to tip herself when I paid with cash. Total was 26 even she said I paid 40$ cash and received 10$ change, nothing major, nothing to make a scene about but it was disappointing. Its just the principle. I woulda tipped have tipped her anyways. Still great spot however please look into this I highly doubt this was a one time thing."

    "reviews": "Amazing food! Got a great deal for a salad a pizza and dessert for 13 dollars. Was really yummy. Table was extreamly sticky like the finish was being taken off by the cleaner but everything else was good I honestly laughed when I opened this box. What I received was a sad excuse for wings, just a few boneless nuggets tossed in their so called Firehouse flavor, which was just basic buffalo sauce with red pepper and jalapeno (Which it did not have). I must also mention these 6 wings that make up together the size of the sauce cup are $9.5 dollars! I felt insulted. And to top it all off, they gave me marinara sauce instead of ranch. Marinara. For wings. I have no idea how that mix up happens.\n\nThis isn't my first time here, and I wish I could say it was just a fluke, but the food is consistently inconsistent. Sometimes it's decent, but more often than not, it's underwhelming.\n\nAs for the staff, they're not outright rude, but they clearly don\u2019t want to be there. Having worked in food service myself, this tells me how things seem to be running. But this seems to be the standard everywhere these days. Sounds like nothing I\u2019m about to post hasn\u2019t happened already, but I just have to share the experience we just had. My husband and I walked in at 3:50pm. No one was up front seating anyone, so we walked back to the bar and the bartender yelled \u201cit\u2019s open seating\u201d. Okay. So we sit and our waitress comes up and brings menus and gets our drink order. Comes back with drinks, we are ready to order. Got an appetizer and two entrees. Fast-forward 37 minutes. She comes to refill drinks and lets us know \u201cappetizer is coming in just a minute\u201d - no comment about the wait or anything. Fine. Appetizer comes out piping hot. She sets it down, walks away and immediately returns with our entrees and says \u201cI didn\u2019t want your food to get cold\u201d. Obviously someone messed up on the timing because our food was cold before it even got to us. Nice. I had ordered a BBQ burger - medium. Took a couple bites and it was pink. Not like medium rare pink, but like all pink. Honestly, I wasn\u2019t going to say anything, because at this point I just wanted to leave as soon as possible. We were over it. But my husband said something to her and she offered to get me a new burger. Fine. New burger comes out 5 minutes later, delivered by someone else - probably a manager or a lead - but this girl slammed the burger in the table, said \u201cburger\u201d then walked away???? No apology, no questions about the first burger, nothing. Just \u201cburger\u201d. What is happening here?? She also had so much perfume on that I could barely breathe. Which I guess is a personal choice, but typically in food service, they discourage anything that interferes with the \u201caroma of the food\u201d. Take two bites of the new burger, it\u2019s burnt to a crisp, drenched in so much BBQ sauce that the bottom bun was completely dissolved. Not eating it. Can\u2019t do it. Long story, but we paid $60 for 2.5 hours of our lives gone and I left hungry, as I only took a total of 3 bites of my food. Neither our waitress or the perfume lady apologized ever for our wait time, experience, the food, any of it. My husband and I have both worked in food service/retail most of our lives, and we are pretty darn easy to deal with. I have never sent food back in my life until today. Definitely go here if you want to leave hungry, with less money and feeling completely ignored for 2 hours. Could be your thing. I brought me Mom out to dinner and we had the BEST time. The staff were awesome and efficient. The food was so good that we ordered more entries to take home for leftovers. The atmosphere was relaxed, comfortable, and charming. We will definitely be back! The Old Chicago's on Wadsworth has really gotten better.  I stopped going there years ago because I never had a good experience.  I decided to give it a go again and was pleased with my experience. Clean bathrooms. 10/10. Would poop there again."

    "reviews": "Fun place, pool table, dart boards, and community united by common love of dogs and nuggets. Drinks are reasonably priced. All the food I've had has been fried, and it's hard to F-up fried, but it's been above average fried so I recommend. Great dive bar walkable in the South Harvey Park neighborhood!  The service was amazing, very friendly and welcoming. The food is good for the price, we paid $25.00 for a lunch for two. And they have a dog friendly patio! We will be back! First time here. I had a large Caeser Salad with blackened chicken and my wife had the Nachos Supreme. My salad was tasty. The romaine lettuce was fresh, the chicken was fairly tender, and it was topped with more than abundant croutons. My wife's nachos were spectacular! The jalapenos were flavorful and the cheese and meat delicious. We immediately devoured the jalapenos. The service was on point. The bar is tidy and welcoming albeit a bit rustic. A lively sports bar with great food & fun atmosphere! A variety of dog photos \ud83d\udcf8 pepper the walls. Several televisions & touch tunes! Cozy outdoor seating with a fire \ud83d\udd25 pit. Our sever (Danette) was delightful. Highly recommend! \u2764\ufe0f She recommended the tostada nachos .. they were quite unique & extraordinarily delicious!! I visited here a year and a half ago and had some awesome wings. Today was not so good. The wings were overcooked and barely edible. The fish was so overcooked we sent it back. The second basket was still overcooked and not worth eating. The waitress didn't even check with us to see if it was better. The fried pickles were overcooked as well. Overall I would not recommend this place. Terrible food and poor service."

Then we played pool for awhile\u2026 much laughter\u2026 the 8-ball won! We\u2019ll be back! More great fun with friends today\u2026 breakfast items, etc! So glad we stumbled upon this place. Great food, perfect dive bar atmosphere! We'll be back. Add their green chili to anything, you won't go wrong. As I was born in this hood in the mid 70s. This place is a staple in my life. Located in special location! The history speaks for itself! Monaghan\u2019s is not. Fine dining. It\u2019s a neighborhood bar and grill which is actually located on the edge of a small neighborhood. As such it\u2019s a really nice. We found it by chance when looking for someplace for lunch and were pleased.  Great friendly service, good food and good prices. Monaghan\u2019s Bar & Grill is a really cool place to visit. The food and service is phenomenal. The bartender who served us at our table was quick and very attentive. There are many options on the menu which is exciting. The menu prices are also great, especially for the portions. We stared out with the green chili for an appetizer. It\u2019s what they are known for and we will definitely get it again. I love BLT sandwiches so I had to try one after the bartender said the chef made a \u201cmean BLT\u201d. It lived up above its expectations, one of the best BLT\u2019s I\u2019ve ever had. We also tried the beef chili relleno. It was huge and delicious, covered in that famous green chili. We will definitely be back. We really appreciated the kind service from our bartender. She was awesome!"

    "reviews": "This place is great I've been here in several occasions plenty of dart boards, a couple pool tables and the drinks are good as well I can't say anything about the food since I haven't tried it but I'm sure it is good staff is friendly Where to start... the bathrooms smell up the entire bar. They do not care or take pride in their establishment. They electronically meter/measure the alcohol pours which slows down the service terribly. Just teach bartenders how to count their pours. Unless you are willing to pay 50 cents per song for the jukebox, expect to enjoy your trip to Longshots in complete silence. Yep, this bar doesn't even do ambient music. Overall, if you can handle the terrible smell, overpriced drinks, and ownership who simply doesn't invest into their own business, then go throw some darts. Bring air fresheners! I heard that the new owner is looking for better reviews but that isn't happening with a waitress that gives horrible service and a condescending attitude to women more beautiful than her. The main bar tender was super nice until she defended the waitress that wouldn't serve us for 45 mins and then blatantly told us that she wouldn't help us unless we were ordering drinks. She is horrible inside and out and either way, it's not a good look for this bar that is otherwise pretty cool Hidden gem off of federal. Lots of pool tables to play on. Small outdoor area to sit if you care to. Bartenders are always friendly and quick to pour a drink. Come to the Longshot lounge the Longshot has a facelift they do a pool tournament on Wednesday night karaoke on Friday Saturday and they also have poker on Mondays Wednesdays Fridays Saturdays at 7:00 p.m. come on down and have some fun oh they also have pinball and pinball tournaments every first Saturday of the month"

    "reviews": "I can't believe I am posting this today, being that I've been a semi-regular of this spot for near ten years.\n\nI loved dining in at bout time for their bacon wrapped jalape\u00f1os and the wings. But sadly, all I found today was disgust and extremely poor treatment.\n\nOnce I had sat down, I had noticed that the kitchen staff kept staring at me off and on, though quite consistently, all with the same smug and angry looks on their faces. I have never met a single one of them prior or have ever seen them in the kitchen at bout time.\n\nI asked the manager what this was all about. He answered that the kitchen staff always seem to be looking like this from the outside, and that it's just a strange spot for the staff to be looking out through windows that run along the bar. It certainly seemed more personal to me. Like I was being profiled or possibly someone thought I was someone who I am not. They should consider getting filling in these windows in the future.\n\nAnyhow, I had seen that the black, male chef had placed my food on the window ledge. It sat there for a good five minutes. Then he took it down and set it somewhere in the kitchen for another five to ten minutes. Finally, my food was placed back up on the ledge for the servers to see it and it sat there again another ten minutes or more. He was the chef that was consistently staring at me off and on. Maybe a rascist. I can't be sure. But I had a seriously bad feeling about how my order was going to turn out.\n\nPlain and simple, my food came to me luke warm and nearly on the cold side. Mozzarella cheese in the sticks were not melted, the bacon was undercooked, and the wings were distasteful. One of them had an aray of feathers still attached. You would hope that the chef would take care of this prior to cooking, and take pride in their work. Maybe, the staff just doesn't give two shits if they have a job or not.\n\nI showed the uncooked bacon to the manager. He said he would get me a new order of jalape\u00f1os. I guess he ordered them extra crispy, which I did not ask of him. The white, female chef with the butch haircut was yelling in the kitchen about having to make new ones. I couldn't believe it. Then the manager served the newly, overcooked, burnt jalapenos to me and asked if this was going to work. To which I replied, \" No, I'm not eating this. These are burnt.\" The manager should have scratched the entire check. Instead, he made me pay for half of it.\n\nThis is straight up the worst dine in experience I've had in years. I won't be going back. In my opinion, the entire staff should be fired. Major overhaul.\n\n!!! Update to the owner's response:\n\nFrom the time that I walked in, up until your manager decided to serve me burnt food, I was polite and decent to your entire staff. I always have been while visiting your restaurant. And I had never received an experience like this before. Yes, there was another \"white male\" cook in the back. Though, he was not staring me down consistently. I truly don't buy it when you say that your  other cooks weren't staring me down. There was obviously some sort of bullshit going on in your kitchen. It's quite easy to tell when your chef explodes and cusses out the manager about having to cook, or do the job they were supposed to be hired for. Oh, and yea, I barely got through half of the plate before the feeling of complete disgust came over me. I hate to inform you but your staff failed. And now you have failed. Not even a genuine and sincere apology from you. You've basically told me to go f*** myself after I have been a loyal customer time and time again for near a decade. I spent my hard worked dollar at your restaurant numerous times. You can bet your a** I won't be back in there. And you can also bet your a** that this post will stay posted for all to read in the future. Hope you're happy \ud83d\ude0a. So finally got to try this place, especially for bingo on my bday. You need more servers. From what I could see it was like  2 for a full restaurant. My dad turned his food away because it sat in the window for almost 30 mins. Your eggroll things and couple other items were bomb... But my marg flatbread tasted like dirty oil and didn't any sauce on it. Just a couple things to work on. This place has amazing food and drink for sure (my favorite is the B.A.B.B. burger and monte cristo egg rolls). I also would recommend the french dip flatbread pizza (just amazing). This is a go-to bar for my friends and I when we are out looking for games to watch on tv or just a spot to chill. The staff here is awesome and genuine for sure, which makes it easy to actually relate with them (not fake like a lot of places I'm used to). It can get a little packed for home games, but so does most places now a days. I will definitely continue returning (especially since there's so much I want to try on the menu that i haven't)! Amazing price for wings and a jalape\u00f1o burger! Amazing service. Definitely worth my spent night out from a stressful week of work. The staff was amazing too. Thank you and hope to come back soon Wanted to try a new pub after work, found this online was excited to give it a try! The atmosphere seemed fun when we walked in lots of tvs, very chill bar vibe. Ordered a sampler plate and some nachos, food was good better than average bar food options and the ladies working were friendly! I always order a double, rocks, short glass splash of cranberry when I go out and was surprised to be charged $1 for the splash of cranberry, when I asked if they charged for the cocktail mixers she said they did and as a bartender myself I found a little off-putting. I've never been charged for a mixer anywhere in 10 years but ok. Overall enjoyable place to grab a drink and watch the game but won't be going back and paying $1 for a mixer on a already $12 drink"

    "reviews": "Was excited to eat, but waited 30 mins for my food, then got it, and it was cold. Some of my wings were not cooked all the way, and I had to stop eating. Our waitress never came to check on us, and the manager ended up getting us our bill. Paid and left. Im really disappointed because I'm a regular bdubs person on Tuesday at my regular location, but we were in the area and wanted some good food. But left hungry and paid for cold, uncooked food.\nThey also charged my card more than what my bill was. I didn't leave a tip and it was $47 but I was charge $60 what the hell. Im so upset\n\nEDIT- called the location and Skylar fixed my situation and apologized for my visit. Very nice guy. The manager (Skylar), was enraged when I politely asked for the normal amount of cheese on my nachos. I often order nachos at multiple locations. I showed him my nachos. It was obvious they were lacking, but he didn\u2019t care. Other than that, my waitress was pleasant and helpful. The food was okay, but refusing to put enough cheese on is just unheard of. When I calmly said I would leave a bad review, he said I had to leave. When I calmly refused his ridiculous demand, he called the cops to have me removed to get revenge for this review. I calmly left when they came and they were in awe that he would use them to get revenge. He told the police I was argumentative. They said he should have given me a little more cheese, but their policies require them to enforce the request to have people removed for any reason. What a disrespectful waste of law enforcement time and valuable resources. I was sober, calm, professional, and politely disagreed, but he blew a gasket when I said I\u2019d leave a bad review. I can share the video with corporate, if they care. (nachos photo attached\u2026 there was even less cheese under this top layer) We are huge advocates for Buffalo Wild Wings! In fact, we order here at least once every other week, sometimes once a week. After a long night of work, we decided to order our food (even though there was a snow storm). Inside, the restaurant was not too busy and we ordered our food at the Togo station. The staff did not look thrilled to be there, they were not rude but just seemed agitated. I ordered LOADED ice cream nachos which normally comes with caramel, cinnamon sugar, fudge, and ice cream. The only thing packed was a small scoop of ice cream with only FOUR chips, which was only enough for half of the ice cream. My roommate wanted boneless wings w/ lemon pepper rub and her sauces on the side. This order was not correct.  The sauce was on half of the wings and the other half were the lemon pepper dry rub. My other roommate ordered 12 traditional wings with lemon pepper dry rub with sauce on the side, they also messed that up. We had no ranch in the bag(s), there was no celery or carrots as well, no wet napkins or ketchup. We are super upset, but we understand sometimes these things happen. We are NOT the type of people to complain over the little things, and 3 of us have worked in the food industry. Mistakes happen, but tonight was not the greatest. Just leaving a review to hopefully catch these mishaps from happening in the future. Seems to be the norm for all BWW locations these days- if you are ordering takeout (placed order on the website) don\u2019t believe the estimated time for pick up. They are never ready when they are supposed to be. We\u2019re currently in the restaurant waiting, it is not busy, maybe 6 tables total. Yet our food is not ready. We\u2019ve been waiting for almost 20 minutes now past when our food was supposed to be done for a total of over an hour. They should have been able to make new food for the amount of time we\u2019ve been waiting. And in the 20 minutes of waiting, 4 other people were able to pick up their orders. Not sure what is going on here, but not impressed. My son and I have given this location 3 tries and it has gotten worse every time. They take forever to seat you when there isn\u2019t any one eating. The service sucks every time. Food is the biggest complaint. Over cooked, under cooked, poor quality the list goes on. But this is the last time we will ever go to any BWW ever again. They served us someone else\u2019s carrots & celery. Here is the pic of the garbage they are serving. You can see the ends had bite marks already. Here\u2019s to them going out of business! All they had to say is they where sorry pathetic."

I hadn't visited in a very long time, but I've been twice in the last month or so and it is still consistently good.   Great margaritas as well. Such a treat to come back here after living here in the 90\u2019s and see it still going strong .  Authentic,  tasty and fresh always . Margaritas are great and it\u2019s also awesome they offer Coors NA that\u2019s ice cold .  Everything you order will be good I promise . Staff is always a delight and it\u2019s clean too . Super friendly service and really great food. The sausage gravy breakfast burrito was incredible! Delicious food, friendly staff, nice atmosphere! My girlfriend said the margarita was not great but once that\u2019s down, it\u2019s five stars across the board. Order the popular Quesorito with Barbacoa. They are all delicious, but something about how they cooked that Barbacoa makes it special. They cover it in cheese, and smother it for a juicy treat!\nPrice: 7\nIt is on the more expensive side for Mexican, but there is a la carte that is reasonable for budget eaters.\nAtmosphere 5\nIt is grungy with bad lighting. It is reminiscent of a dive bar, with sports and many tvs. It is a cross of dive bar but with some solid Mexican-American food. Interesting atmosphere and concept.\nQuality 8\nThis is above average Mexican-American food. Delicious Barbacoa, carnitas, and Carne Asada options. Their signature dish the Quesorito is large, delicious, and full of flavor.\nQuantity 9\nThe South has large portions across the menu. Even drinks are bigger than standard. If you are hungry or thirsty, this is the place to do it\nService 9\nThe service was great, but nothing over the top. Attentive, friendly, and kind. Everything you would want from a server."

    "reviews": "Wow!  This place is amazing!  Margaritas are so refreshing and the BOGO is well worth it.  Food is always fresh and so delicious!  You will not be disappointed!  The service is amazing!  Nicole is there for you if you need anything, and the owner Myrna is always out talking to guests. We have traveled all OVER Mexico these past 40 years. Chula\u2019s ranks right up there with the best.\nAs close to authentic as you can get here in the USA. I ordered the Birria Tacos and they were amazing. Tonight they had 2 for 1 Margaritas and BOTH were excellent.\nThey had a huge party in the dining room yet our service was great.\nThey deserve a 10 star rating. Nicole is an awesome waitress and has treated us so well on our multiple visits.  The food here is great and I can't wait for some warmer days to try out the beautiful patio We catered an event at home through Myrna and Chula on Broadway and we loved the breakfast taco bar they put together for us (including delivery and set up). Great food, able to accommodate dietary restrictions, and friendly service. Our visit was disappointing overall. The atmosphere was just okay\u2014half the time we were there, the TVs weren\u2019t playing anything, which made things feel a bit dull. The service, however, was the biggest issue. The waitress, who also hosted us, seemed visibly annoyed from the start. We were the only Hispanic guests in the restaurant, and it was hard not to notice how much more friendly and welcoming she was with white customers. The difference in treatment was uncomfortable and very noticeable.\n\nThe food was just okay. My son\u2019s burger had a broken bottom bun, so he couldn\u2019t hold it properly and I had to help him eat. On 2 burgers meals we were only given two ketchup packets per each, which wasn\u2019t ideal. The best part of the meal was the chips and salsa.\n\nI hope the management takes a serious look at how all guests are being treated. Everyone deserves to feel welcome and respected."

    "reviews": "We attended a free art event they have every other Thursday. We ordered some pretzel bites & pop. The ice was in small bits, I like that. The people were so nice and welcoming. We got to try a new cucumber sandwich they were experimenting with. I think they should add it to the menu. Thank you for including us. We had a great experience at BrewAbility! I love the fact that this brewery hires adults with disabilities and focuses on inclusivity and opportunity. Accessibility is clearly a priority here, from the color system that is used to order, to the \u201csensory corner\u201d with noise cancelling headphones. We will definitely be back! Absolutely the best brewery in town! Service was outstanding and the selection of pizza was not only surprising, but there was enough variety for everyone! I can't recommend this place enough, regardless of ability this is the go-to spot for many. (And for damn good reason!) Excellent variety of beer, and while I didn't eat the pizza, it looked and smelled delicious. The staff were all amazing, and very friendly. The outdoor space is great during the summer time! It's establishments like this that make the world a better place. My hat goes off to them and my heart goes out as well. Tiffany puts a lot of time and effort into setting up events that draw people in. There are plenty of menu options for food and drink. The staff works hard, and does a good job to make sure your needs are met. I've been coming here since it was the B.O.B., and Accoustic Music Revival before that. This is the best yet. I make it here 2 to 3 times a month. It is always time well spent. Thank you Brewability!"

    "reviews": "One Barrel was a good, solid dining experience. It was our first time, so as a Local Guide, we were dialed into the food, service and atmosphere. We liked the linen napkins and the modern decor. My spouse got the petite filet with mashed potatoes instead of the skillet potatoes.  It was a good, quality piece of meat. I got the One Barrel burger and actually enjoyed it more than the filet. Fries were good and crispy. I had the rotating house red wine, which tasted like a decent red blend. The reason for the 4 stars, across the categories, is that nothing stood out as extraordinary. The food was certainly good, but not outstanding. The service was fine (we don\u2019t prefer the \u201chow are WE doing? What are WE eating?\u201d language, but that may be a personal server quirk.), but nothing stood out as 5-star. The atmosphere was equally fine. Our reservation was at 6:30p, but the lights were full power till just before we left at 7:30p. Would have enjoyed a bit more cozy lighting for our dinner ( We did \u201clight\u201d our table candle just to make it feel like a candlelight meal.). So, yes! Go to this place. It is lovely. Not 5-star extraordinary, but a very solid choice in the heart of Englewood. Maybe we\u2019ll go back when the rooftop seating is open!  We will definitely try again! We were in the Denver area recently and found One Barrel in Englewood while we were out looking for a place to have lunch. We had the calamari with some crazy good sauce, and the Italian Grinder. Off the charts good! Ended up chatting with the owner, Jamie, and couldn't help but notice and say how much we appreciated a restaurant where the owner and staff truly care about their craft and service. So many restaurants simply don't care about the food that comes out of their kitchen, but not One Barrel - you can taste their pride and dedication to what they do. Just amazing. We'll be back in the area soon and will definitely be returning to One Barrel to try other dishes on their excellent menu. Thank you Jamie for a wonderful experience. This is a really nice place with friendly staff, the downside was we were really hungry and they were really slow with our food because they had a corporate event, but the wait was worth it.\nWe tried the charcuterie and bread plates, both were absolutely amazing. Then we had Bone In Ribeye for 2 (it really should say for 3-4), and Chicken Schnitzel.\nUnfortunately there was no room for dessert this time. This place is classy and I'm surprised I haven't heard more about it. The food and service was impeccable!  We had the bread cheese (never would had ever thought it would be that good) very different and amazing display and also had the calamari, sweet and a hint of spice \ud83d\ude0b delicious! For my main course I had the chicken schnitzel and again mix wondrrful mix of flavors. Loved the sauerkraut and sweet jam like sauce. So good! Service was also top notch. Definitely will be back and recommend for anyone looking for a nice date night. We have eaten here several times before because they offer a really great deal through Groupon.\nWe went for my husband's Birthday and this is still a place where they offer a free dessert for the birthday boy. Which is refreshing.\nThis time the food was the best we've ever had there.\nWe started with 2 different appetizers 1 being the fried Calamari. It was cooked well with a nice sweet chili sauce. The Calamari was soft definitely not too chewy. We also got the jalapeno artichoke dip which was wonderful. Excellent flavor and plenty of it.\nFor our entrees we got the pork chop and Cod and split them both. The pork chop was huge and had a lot of flavor. It was served on succotash with a side of some sort of horseradish green. The Cod was cooked perfectly to my liking and was paired with a strange celery puree with a very unique taste. I found the taste of the puree strangely tart and the Fish a little too mild until I ate them together and they were great. The potato chips made out of fingerlings were adorable and tasty.\nHusband received a birthday dessert on the house candle and all. It was not a very attractive dish but had a great taste and made him happy which in turn made me happy."

    "reviews": "Recently moved to the neighborhood and love bakeries so we had to try this place out, and we instantly fell in love !!! From the moment we arrived to when we left, we felt like family here. The best service I have experienced so far ! The design of the place is beautiful and brilliant, If you\u2019re looking for any baked goods or coffee in the morning this is the place !! I am excited to try this place in the evening when they are serving dinner \ud83c\udf7d\ufe0f definitely recommend to anyone who loves food or drinks ! Our experience this afternoon was pure delight - if you want a true Nonna\u2019s experience Denver style -fun, friendly , good vibe, great price point and the espresso martini  and limoncello true italiano style\nAsk for Travis - the non server server who knows what it takes to make you feel like family AS GOOD AS IT LOOKS!! After a year off to renovated beautifully,  my rare favorite restaurant is BACK And still fantastic!!! The people are always friendly with great service and even better food. The desserts are PERFECT!! Not only look beautiful,  but TASTE GREAT!! NO disappointment here with pretty desserts that taste like cardboard! THESE ARE THE REAL THING- do not come here on a diet! Gallo is back! My favorite pastry case in Denver is full again. What a relief, the King Soopers sushi across the street from the kava bar was getting old. I had an absolutely enormous pepperoni calzone and a variety of pastries. Having poked around the desserts a bit, I think my favorite are the pistachio amaretti cookies and the vanilla lobster tails. Glad I don't live close by as it would become a problem.\n\nThe interior refresh is nice, more open, and cleaner looking. The entrance way makes more sense now. The staff are pleasant and welcoming. While I ordered takeout this time, I'll be glad to return for a sit down experience. Saw this spot reopening from the Downtown Englewood Instagram and man was this a treat! I took my family and I, we were seated fairly quickly before the rush, our hostess (I believe one of the owners) graciously told us about her family and the restaurant, how her dad makes the fantastic pastries there (raspberry tiramisu 10/10). We ordered drinks, arancini, spaghetti bolognese, Caesar salad and minestrone soup and the chicken Marsala. Everything was delicious, fresh and perfectly cooked!! Truly wonderful atmosphere and good pricing for the top quality food and service. Fully recommend supporting this wonderful local business!"

The service was so good and pleasant, our food came out so fast, almost to a fault \ud83d\ude06 (our app came out barely before our pies, not a big deal). The pizzas were solid, I enjoyed my beers, the kids enjoyed the games, great place over all! Definitely an option when we're in the area again. Such a great place! The mission statement,  food, and aesthetic of this restaurant were all wins for me. Accessibility and inclusion,  respect and dignity.  These should be accounted for in every business. It is exciting to see an ongoing shift regarding differently abled people and their contribution to the world. I was pleased to see that Pizzability utilizes the skills and talents of those who are too often overlooked/undervalued in our community. Pizza was wonderful the atmosphere was great and the owner and workers deserve business just because they treat everyone so kindly!!!!  I will be a regular the Pizza is to die for!!! The pizza was phenomenal. The sauce was super flavorful. The slices are ginormous. The service is impeccable. Neat, kid-friendly restaurant! We were greeted by owner Tiffany, who was so kind and gracious. She shared with us the restaurant's mission of hiring people of varied physical and intellectual abilities. We ordered a pepperoni pizza, it came out fast, and was very delicious! There is a lounge area with a large table- perfect for kids. My son thoroughly enjoyed all the games and activities offered. There is even a guide dog and what a sweet soul he is! I definitely recommend stopping in for pizza. It's more than just a restaurant- it's an inclusive community honoring  people of all abilities."

She told my friend that he had a five minute time limit in the bathroom that it was company policy I don't believe that shit for a minute she is outta of her mind Qdoba has always been my favorite go to for a big ass burrito. Typically I have to get mine double wrapped because no employee except a few have been able to wrap my monster size burrito perfectly. And each time I bet that I won't spill even a single piece of rice(which i never do) no one ever believes me. If I was serious about my bets i would be rich. I would think as a person who tries to earn tips and is also a manager would have better service. Using 4oz cups and still under portioning. CROSS CONTAMINATING! His other manager comes in and then he works correctly! Girl looked mad at the world. Steak was dry. They have a smaller ladle for the queso than other locations.  Out of small and medium cups. Required to by large I have tried this location 3 times and I guarantee  there won\u2019t be a 4th. This is the rudest staff I have ever dealt with.  I\u2019m always willing to give somebody a chance,  maybe they\u2019re just having a bad day. Nope, not the case here. Plus you could hear somebody screaming at somebody from the offices in the back. If I could give this place zero stars I would. I will just stick with chipotle ."

Great food, great staff, and the best atmosphere! Highly recommend working with Emily, George, and the team to plan your next event at The Feedery/Grow & Gather. We will be back! What a DELICIOUS and GREAT EXPERIENCE!!!\n\nFrom the moment I got there until the moment I left I was treated like family and with excellent service!\n\nI happened to walk up on this gem after a dr appointment! As much ingredients as they can are served from their own garden! How AMAZING! You can even purchase from their garden on site.\n\nTessa was my server and she was everything and more that you would want in a server and especially in a first time experience!!! She gave a great suggestion as I couldn\u2019t choose which sandwich was best to try first!\n\nI had the chicken pesto sandwich- if you love basil and pesto flavor it was so good and the pesto is house made! The sandwich was juicy and fresh and hot! Bread was perfectly toasted. I ate the whole thing \ud83d\ude01\n\nI got the Caesar side salad instead of fries. I haven\u2019t tried the salad yet as I\u2019m taking it home for later.\n\nAfter looking more at the menu I noticed they have a full service coffee bar which intrigued me so I tried the iced mocha decaf coffee and let me just say it was so so perfect!!! Perfect blend of chocolate and coffee flavors! I used oat milk for mine.\n\nI also couldn\u2019t resist trying the desserts of the week they had on display!\n\nThe Baklava and Chocolate cake are delicious! The chocolate cake is so moist and perfect amount of chocolate chips - super fresh and yummy and not too rich!\n\nThe Baklava was crispy juicy and fresh.\n\nMy only regret is I forgot to try the homemade ice cream , as I\u2019m sure it\u2019s absolutely delicious with the chocolate cake, but I will def be back to try more!!!\n\nThe atmosphere was clean and peaceful and so pleasant!!! I\u2019m so happy with my experience here today!! Thank you!!!! What a great place to eat! The food is extremely fresh, the taste is amazing, and the price is reasonable. It's cool that they repurposed an old auto service place and stuck a greenhouse on the top! I would love to walk though there. There's a nice little patio seating area with a little natural local garden space. There's also a little market with a variety of local things. If you're in the area, or even have a little drive to get here, I recommend the visit! The food and atmosphere was incredible. Especially loved the spinach artichoke dip, shrimp scampi pasta, and the dessert (Oreo cheesecake ice cream and the toffee Bundt cake). Service could have just been an off night (hoping as we loved the food and place). First time here was a success! What a cool, unique restaurant and the food was delicious. Good value for the price. Sometimes \"healthy\" restaurants are bland, but that was not the case here! Everything tasted great. They have dine-in, or you can do grab-and-go to eat by the rooftop greenhouse. Will definitely be coming back!"

The staff is always nice and food is always fresh and quick. I've been to other dunkins in the area and this one is by far superior. CHECK YOUR RECEIPTS! They are STEALING!Every time I went through the drive through, there was ALWAYS!!! A small item added, ($0.25-$0.50) insignificant enough to go back and argue, but brings in at least a few thousand $$$ for them. Horrible experience.  Every time I come to this particular location, it is a horrible experience. And I uh, I always try to give them another chance.And go back but I will never return this time. I only gave it a one star because it made me give it a star Unfortunately, the reviews about rude staff are true. I go to this Dunkin every single day. I\u2019ve come every single day for months. I\u2019ve always had decent experiences until today. The staff member at the window was so, so very rude. She ignored me, spoke over me when I made a request, told me to have a good day to which I replied \u201cthank you,\u201d and she very rudely quipped \u201cOR NOT.\u201d I have no idea what warranted this mean girl behavior. I called the store to let them know, and I must\u2019ve spoken with the same worker, because I was hung up on.\n\nI understand that everyone has bad days, but I\u2019ve always been so incredibly sweet to the folks at this store. The last time I spoke with this worker, I gushed over how much I loved her nightmare before Christmas nails. I don\u2019t understand why she was so mean to me today. I\u2019m sad that I\u2019ll have to stop coming to my favorite place every day- I don\u2019t to risk another interaction that paints my morning in the way this did. My passenger suggested a call to the district manager or to corporate; I won\u2019t be doing that. People have bad days. I just wish her bad day didn\u2019t have to become mine. I don't get donuts as often as I used to, but I have stopped off at Dunkin' Donuts a few times since I've been in Denver on business.   Chocolate donuts with chocolate icing are delicious and used to be my favorites.\n\nThat being said, I remember when the icing looked like it was placed on the donut on purpose.   These days it looks like it was accidentally spilled on the donut and then smeared around when they tried to wiped it off.\n\nThis is their new standard and the donuts look like this every time I go there."

We love playing pool  and drinking here! Whole staff is awesome! Totally recommend for having a good time! Daniel is a great new owner to this place since June and adding so many exciting things, kitchen is open with amazing food menu, phenomenal bartenders, trivia on Tuesday, DJ on Friday and karaoke on Saturday and totally new interior! Love this local place and worth the drive!! Don\u2019t forget breakfast on Saturday and Sunday open at 9:30 am for early football games with a breakfast menu!! They have AMI but constantly override songs. The food is extremely hit and miss.  Good for beers, seltzers, or simple mixed drinks along with some pool."

Thank you so much for the finely chopped scallions in the soup \u2014 it made me feel like I was back home in Asia.\ud83d\ude4f Ok, soooo, I'm so excited to write this review because my favorite restaurant, Sushi Sasa closed permanently. My favorite rolls EVER, were the Scottish Salmon and Pink Lady. My friends and I were so sad to hear that Sushi Sasa closed. Just yesterday, we visited this place after finding out the same chef works there, and my goodness... The food was absolutely amazing! We started with the crazy spicy cucumber, which is moldy spicy, then ordered the blue fin tuna nigiri and yellow tail nigiri. The blue fin tuna melted like butter.. God damn..\nWe ofcourse/obviously ordered the Scottish Salmon and Pink Lady roll, then ended our meal with the eel handroll, which was fabulous! Eel is hit or miss for me, but this one was amazing! We are in town for a few weeks for medical stuff and stumbled on this place our first night and wow, it did not disappoint!  Delicious fresh sushi, most welcoming and attentive staff, and beautiful intimate setting!  We sat at the bar and met the owner and he was so kind and even made me off menu request.  6 stars! Fish was excellent. Pricey, but delicious. Space is small. Not sure I would want to be here with a party greater than two. Bright, clean, nice staff. Great drink selection. Try the Diablo Roll - it may be the best sushi roll I\u2019ve ever eaten in my life. And I\u2019ve eaten a lot of sushi rolls! Tiny little restaurant owned by former Sushi Den employee Wayne (worked there for 9 years in the 90s). He also owns Sushi Sasa. The seaweed salad had a wide variety of seaweed and was a perfect appetizer along with the spicy Japanese pickles. All the nigiri was delicious and the rolls we ordered were all super fresh tasting. Nice little hole in the wall sushi spot that might be our new go to!"

The queso was gelatinous and the chips so salty and saturated with oil we just threw them away:/ at the very least will be longer be doing pickup orders there.

Everything was packaged well and their team set everything up for our group. I would definitely recommend ordering for any future catering needs for corporate groups or parties, etc. We will definitely be ordering again! Olivia and her staff were amazing tonight. She greeted us as we walked in and checked on us while we sat there and ate. Great tasting food. Qdoba lost my business for good because of how gross the steak was. Couldn\u2019t eat it. It really didn\u2019t even seem like real food. The texture and taste was just awful."

    "reviews": "EXCELLENT SERVICE!  The waitress/bartender is superb!  The food is outstanding! Try the Green Chili!  Great TVs for games and darts, pool tables and a great Shuffleboard table! I assume/hope the food is better when served in house. I got a to go order because I wanted a good not fast food burger but also wanted to stay in, and their menu sounded pretty good. Not to be mean but I wish I would have just gone to McDonald\u2019s instead. After tip I paid a little over $19 for this burger and fries. It was very dry and flavorless. I didn\u2019t know it also didn\u2019t come with cheese which was pretty disappointing, I would have definitely ordered some if I had known. The online option also insinuated that it would be coming with a salad as well. It asked what dressing I would like for my salad, I selected blue cheese, and they gave me blue cheese dressing but no salad. The fries were also very over cooked and dry, almost no salt on it too. Overall not a great meal and for the price I can\u2019t say I will be coming back. Such a great \"dive\" bar. I hesitate to make this review because I kind of want to gate-keep it. They have the nicest staff, really delicious food, and all of the bar games. I would call this an upscale dive bar. The atmosphere is great and there is a lot of space but it still feels \"homey\" and quaint. The service we got was not bad. It just seemed like a weird choice for the kickball organization to pick a place that we overwhelmed so easily. Food was all right, but unseasoned. We\u2019ll be back, hoping that they can ease the burden on staff and maybe have another person or two in the evenings to help the two people there. Relaxed place to play some pool after with a friend who was teaching me. I consider myself a Reuben connoisseur \u2014 I\u2019ve had them across cities, states, even countries \u2014 and let me tell you, the Reuben at The Hound Sports Bar is hands down the best Reuben I\u2019ve ever had in my life. Perfectly grilled, insanely flavorful, and just the right balance of savory, tangy, and melty goodness. I\u2019m still thinking about it.\n\nBut it\u2019s not just the food. The vibe? Immaculate. Think cozy neighborhood pub meets your favorite sitcom hangout. Honestly, it felt like I had walked straight into How I Met Your Mother. Warm lighting, relaxed atmosphere, and a layout that makes you want to stay a while.\n\nThey\u2019ve got fabulous pool tables, shuffleboard, and other games, but it\u2019s not a loud, chaotic sports bar. It\u2019s got that chill, welcoming energy \u2014 the kind of place you could make your go-to spot with friends or unwind solo with a drink and a game.\n\nDo yourself a favor: go for the Reuben, stay for the vibes."

    "reviews": "You definitely need to eat in at Zane's for it to be worth it and have the full experience. We live nearby and have sat in and had a great time with massive portions and good food for the value. We also love supporting a local establishment that's for the neighborhood. You get what you pay for here normally, big portions with good enough food to fill you up.\n\nBut do not order to go. We decided to have a fast meal and order out to eat at home, and their $25-28 pasta (the foicchi and lasagna) were abysmal. It was unfortunate given how fun Zane's is in person. At $89 for our meal, it was disappointing to see a 12 piece pasta arrive in the box for $28. It would have been better to drive the extra 2 minutes to Oliver's down the street for high quality pasta at the same price point.\n\nFlavor wise things here are usually tasty enough, and I have enjoyed their appetizers a lot on the past.\n\nAnyway, definitely a place to swing by during happy hour just to chill and have a bite, more of a neighborhood hangout than anything else. The food here is Italian American and very good. The Venetian Fiocchi is actually something I used to get occassionally when I lived in Italy. The pear and cheese filling and balsamic drizzle make the dish. The free breadsticks are good with the sauce that comes with them but the sauce is overwhelming for this particular dish.\n\nService was a mixed bag. There was no one at the hostess desk for at least 10 minutes. When I tried to ask the bartender if anyone was manning the desk he just said \"I'm busy\" and never did ask what we wanted. There was another group behind me also waiting. When I finally got a table and asked for tea, it never came. After another long wait a server asked if I'd been helped. She was very good. The space is very nice. The bar area has TVs showing sports.\n\nThere is ample parking. This is a very nice bar and restaurant that has a great atmosphere and happy hour.  Zane treated us and everyone like old friends and the staff was very professional.  The establishment is a lot larger inside than I thought with separate areas which I thought was nice!  This might just be your favorite bar/restaurant.  I will definitely recommend this to everyone! Super delicious Italian gem ! We came during happy hour which was the BEST! I had the hardest time picking what I wanted on the menu! The waiter was so patient with me! I ended up ordering the Shrimp Alfredo. I had the Broccoli Cheddar soup too, which was equally delicious. The bread sticks we had before was the perfect blend of crispy, savory, and just down right delicious!\n\nUpdate 12/23 - went back here recently and it's the same delicious place! \u2764\ufe0f We were struggling to make ourselves do the yard work that needed to be done today. The motivation - we could go to Zane\u2019s for Half price drinks and appetizers if we got it done. We did. And the reward was worth it.\n\nSince moving back to the Denver area, this has been one of our favorites. The food is awesome - old school Italian. The cocktails are tasty and generous. And the half price apps and cocktails is everyday until 6 PM.\n\nLooking forward to many more drinks and great food for years to come."

Watching how they treat customers that don\u2019t look like them is a joke. They don\u2019t even hide their racism. I heard a woman bartender use slurs to a couples face. Place smells like raw sewage, your feel stick to the floor the minute you walk in. Bathrooms were straight up disgusting. The worst I\u2019ve even seen in any type of establishment. As you can guess, the bartenders are horrible, rude, openly racist, and borderline incompetent. I can say without a shadow of a doubt, this is the worst bar I\u2019ve even walked into. We walked over to the brewery and shared our experience with them. Not a single person working there and the two tables next to us had a single good thing to say about them. Nothing short of a horrible bar. Would give it zero stars if I could. Bartender was amazing it wasn't very packed one of the patrons there that was playing darts bought us a shot for Easter. Oh really liked this bar. It's fine! We came when it was pretty busy. It's definitely hard to kill the vibe in this place.\n\nThe wings are really good. Lots of sauce. I recommend the honey hot. The blonde bartender has been very racist and did not even want to read my ID because it is not in \u201cEnglish\u201d, very bad way to ask us to leave, she told us that there was no menu, we were hungry and wanted a drink and she simply decided close the opportunity."

    "reviews": "Just delish wings and fries!  Get the Golden Flame sauce, so yummy! \ud83d\ude0b\nThe Aurora location has been remodeled since I was there last and it is SO much nicer now!  They even have better ranch (which used to be just gross) now so that\u2019s good!  But I do recommend using blue cheese for your fries instead!  My mouth is watering just remembering how good it is!\nMy lunch mark was close to $25 so it is a little expensive but was a nice treat! The food was great - wide variety of sauce choices. I had the mountain berry and the Shanghai sizzle - both delicious, mountain berry quickly became my favorite. Fries are delicious, portions are insane! My only issue and reason I didn't give 5 stars was the music - a never-ending stream of bro country is super grating when you just wanna eat a decent meal. best wings in town! love the honey mustard and bqq blaze wings! and the fries are really good, they have multiple kinds and the garlic fries are my favorite I really loved this place!  It has a nice cool neighborhood vibe.  It's much more authentic than the big wing chains.\n\nI went by accident.  I could complete my order at the Tarvern Theater so stopped at Golden Flame Hot Wings.  It was packed with Brincos fans....vs. The Raiders.  Go, Broncos!  I hate wings with batter.  They did not have battered wings but a variety of flavors.  I got 2 different rubs.  Fried perfect and crispy.  There is an awesome selection of beers, too.  They serve beer for the table in a table sized plastic keg.\n\nThe crowd was multi-racial harmony.  ...mainly Gen X and a few Boomers.  Staff were Gen Zs and X.  .. Nice vibe.  Great wings and beer.  But also appetizers, wraps, sandwiches, and seafood. My first visit. I grabbed wings and breaded cauliflower. Wings are often overcooked, these were perfect. I\u2019m very impressed. I\u2019ll be ordering soon."

The apples were super fresh, and although I ordered them to replace the home fries, they game me some anyways (which were also really good, a nice crunch and spicy to them).\n\nCoffee was watered down but still tasted okay.\n\nThe staff was super friendly too. The cost of the entire meal was just under $7. Definitely recommend giving Wendy\u2019s a try, they\u2019ve got a lot of options at affordable prices. Enjoy! Update - DON'T waste your money on the Krabby Patty SpongeBob meal. $11 for a medium fry and a small burger with a small frosty. And nothing with SpongeBob on it, no toy, not the bag, nothing, very disappointing for the kids.\n\nWay overpriced for the same menu items if ordered separately.\n\nAnd this location has a new AI drive thru sign and system, I personally did not like the experience. Went through the drive-through at 9:30 in the morning. Ordered the number 8 breakfast, sausage egg and cheese. I could tell right away just by the appearance of the food that it was not fresh. The fries or potatoes were dry, crispy, barely warm and tasteless. The breakfast sandwich had clearly been sitting for a while as the egg was withered the sausage was Brown and overcooked and the cheese had already settled from being melted  Once upon a time. Over all\u2026 Completely dissatisfied and to be honest I took 2 bites and the rest was in the trash not worth the $6 and some change by any means. The new AI drive order system is extremely inconvenient, and it has consistently gotten my order wrong since the change. Not only was my hamburger prepared incorrectly, but the kids meal did not even have the toy. Do not order from this location. Bad ordering experience and bad service. Worst Wendy\u2019s in colorado. Customer service far below average. Ordered medium frosty\u2019s they gave smalls. Frosty\u2019s had ice cream all over sides of cup very messy. No care at all. Fries and nuggets were cold and old. Burger had excessive Mayo on it as you can see in pictures. I also saw employees not changing gloves or washing hands after touching face nose and mouth with gloves on. Employees very rude and lazy. 5 people standing around and 1 person actually trying to work and keep up. Will never go back to this location. Very disgusting! Didn\u2019t even eat food just threw it away."

The only reason I\u2019ve been holding out on my review after a year of coming in is all because I love how it\u2019s not always crowded. The staff is very friendly and attentive they can take a table of 10 order, not write it down and still get everything correct! Their spicy broth with grilled shrimp is a 12/10. This location is the best pho hands down. Whenever I\u2019m in the Denver area, I stop here for a Vietnamese, eggrolls and grilled chicken spring rolls.\nI\u2019ve ordered them at a lot of places in the past.\nThese are by far the best flavor, best price, and largest portion. The egg rolls were truly like one of the best I\u2019ve ever had but the pho was a little disappointing. I bet their vermicelli is amazing I\u2019ll have to come back and try! A bald man at the cash register was very impatient and rude when I was placing a togo order. I am very disappointed because I have always loved the restaurant. When I asked a question about the menu, he stated \u201cI am very busy\u201d. Well, aren\u2019t we all?! I went there to get my ill child and I some dinner after a long work day myself. When he handed me my bags of food \u201cimpatiently\u201d, it almost fell on the floor. Thankfully, I believe the owner came out and helped me with the bags. Thank you to the owner for your kindness.

Today we ordered the blackened chicken salad and the Cobb salad sub breaded chicken add avocado. The portions are huge and the quality is great. I highly recommend giving this place a try for drama free pool playing and way better than average grill.\n\nThe photos are going to keep coming because so are we \ud83d\ude0e\ud83d\ude01 You wouldn't expect it, but the food's really good hit this pool hall, so to speak, the people are great. They take them amazing care of you. They have quality pool sticks.If you're looking and their accessories are very affordable. If you\u2019re looking for the perfect pool hall experience, Felt is the place to be! From the moment you walk in, the atmosphere is inviting, with well-maintained tables, great lighting, and a lively yet comfortable vibe. Whether you\u2019re a casual player or a serious competitor, this is the ideal spot to rack up some fun.\n\nThe food at Felt is top-notch\u2014far beyond what you\u2019d expect from a typical pool hall. The menu offers a variety of delicious options, from classic bar bites to hearty meals, all made with quality ingredients and great attention to flavor.\n\nWhat truly sets this place apart, though, is the exceptional service. Our server, Anya, was fantastic\u2014attentive, friendly, and always making sure we had everything we needed. Her energy and professionalism added to the already great experience, making our night even more enjoyable.\n\nIf you\u2019re in the area and looking for a place with great pool, amazing food, and outstanding service, Felt is a must-visit. Highly recommend\u2014especially if you get the chance to be served by Anya! We like coming here to have a little time for ourselves. There\u2019s a pretty big list of different cuisines to suit your mood. Drinks, pool, fire pit outside. The first time we visited we just played pool and had a few drinks. Last night was our second time coming and we had dinner, did not disappoint. The staff are awesome too. We recommend trying it out, plenty of pool tables \ud83d\ude0e\n\nUpdate: We still come here on the regular. Y\u2019all, their hand breaded chicken strips are fire as F but today I had the hand breaded chicken filet, and let me tell you, it was absolutely amazing as well. My husband had the chicken fried rice and it was equally as bomb. \ud83d\udca3 \ud83e\udd24\n\nWe have been ordering the blackened chicken salads \ud83e\udd24 pro tip: sub breaded chicken and add an egg..it\u2019s literally my new fav \ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude0d\n\nOh and don\u2019t forget to add one of each or more of these massive hand size brownies and chocolate chip cookies. The quality of them both is mouthwatering when you are craving something sweet. Pics for reference \ud83d\udc9f We love coming here!!! The food is outstanding and all the staff are simply the best! Maarten is the man y\u2019all. I\u2019ve never been offered a homemade coconut macaroon( which by the way was the mf bomb \ud83e\udd24), his customer service is above and beyond. Today, we had another homemade macaroon \ud83e\udd24\u2026(yes different day haha!) bombzies!!!\n\nTony and Savannah \ud83d\udc8b\ud83d\udc95\ud83d\udcaf are always so on top of making sure we are very well taken care of. Jarrin and Summer are also super cool. \ud83d\ude0d we refuse to play pool anywhere else. This is OUR spot. Check it out and you will find out it\u2019s literally the place to be any day of the week.\n\nWe came baaaaack!!! Of course \ud83e\udd2d to post some more photos of the bomb ass food!"

Was really craving a biscuit sandwich\u2014 no biscuits.\nThe overall atmosphere is a sports bar. The tables are weirdly hard to sit at? Not sure what that\u2019s about. Fantastic brunch spot! One of the best breakfast burritos ever! Super crispy bacon, amazing green chili, and even better sausage gravy! Biscuits and gravy are on point and that's coming from a southern girl! Great brunch happy hour on Saturday and Sunday from 10-11 $6 Burritos or Gravy and Biscuits and $3 Bloody Mary's that are on point! $3 Mimosas also. Great happy hours during the week! Fabulous spot to grab lunch or dinner! The owner Aaron is super friendly! The food was just ok.  Had the Fried Chicken Sandwich but was disappointed with the size of the chicken.  Not much chicken, mostly breading.  We had the Pretzel bites to start off but they were very average and could have been store bought.  The fries were the best thing that we had.  They only had 3 servers on for the whole place so had to wait a really long time for everything. I had a lovely early dinner here with my friend. This was a momentous day because I lived near South Broadway for several years and never made it to this restaurant. The brussels sprouts were awesome. My old-fashioned was good. My beer on tap did not disappoint. The burger was also great and didn\u2019t fall apart too much. The water had a weird taste to me though. Had a great dining experience at the Whiskey Biscuit on Saturday night with a group of friends. We had made a reservation for a group of eight and were seated promptly upon arrival. We enjoyed the pretzel bites, fried green tomatoes, and biscuit beignets as an appetizer. I definitely risked it for the biscuit and tried a shrimp po\u2019boy in Denver. I was pleasantly surprised it was quite tasty and had saut\u00e9ed shrimp versus fried shrimp. The remoulade sauce was very good. I would definitely return to the Whiskey Biscuit."

    "reviews": "Nearly 2pm on a Friday it was easy to order and find a seat. I asked for a brisket sandwich, fried mac n cheese bites. and sweet potato casserole as sides. The sandwich was perfectly prepared and had great smoke flavor. The sides were too hot to eat upon arrival, but that is not a detriment. They were a great end to the meal.\n\nI asked for a Jameson and Ginger to accompany my meal. They don\u2019t carry Jameson or have Ginger ale on tap. I ended up with a Tullamore DEW and sprite with a splash of coke and dash of bitters. It was close enough.\n\nNot a regular haunt for me, but I\u2019ve been previously and will visit again. Definitely recommend it for casual BBQ and live music at night. Okay I didn\u2019t actually eat here, I was here for a show, but what a cool place! Nice little concert area, and in between sets you can check out the bowling/arcade/billiards area which wasn\u2019t too crowded on a Friday night. Really hit a vibe sweet spot for me. Dig it, it\u2019s like if punch bowl was chill as hell. Never had a bad meal hear. Adore the fried pickles, they give you so many! The banana pudding was small but very tasty. Pulled pork sandwich with white sauce was amazing!! Chicken strips were high quality We paid for a concert and the door guy was a jerk.   If he doesn't enjoy his job get a new one.  Yes I treated him back the same way I was treated.   He was a Jerk as was I.\nThe place was nice, I am sure the food was good but after the way we were handled by the door guy, I didn't spend any money inside.  Watched our show and left, never to return. Usually love this place but the tofu sandwich at this particular location has really gone downhill.  Based on which location I go to, its either delicious cubes with crispy edges or a wet mess.  The Boulder location really has the recipe locked in.  I ordered the tofu sandwich at the South Broadway location before the Gatecreeper show at the Gothic and it was just a square block of tofu that maybe hit the grill for two minutes on each side.  Not cut into smaller cubes, no care put into its preparation, it basically seemed like someone just hacked a brick of tofu in half and slapped it on the grill before throwing it on a bun.  I love when restaurants have an option or two for the vegetarians and every other location seems to have someone on staff that knows how to cook tofu.  I paid $20 for a sandwich that eventually became a pile of wet slop and I really don\u2019t wanna gamble on this locations tofu sandwich anymore.  I really appreciate that a BBQ restaurant would put a vegetarian option on their menu but if its not prepared with the same care as the brisket or chicken then its basically just a $20 slap in the face."

Last time I visited there was in April 2017. This coffee shop is situated very close to the Englewood Civic Center. It has both indoor and outdoor sitting option available. Recently when I went there, their POS machine was not working And the barista there was offering me a free drink later on I figured out that I had cash and I could pay it with it. I recommend people to check this place out. It is really cozy and welcoming coffee shop. Fantastic coffee shop! I am already a fan of the area thanks to the museum, trolleys, parks, and beautiful statues. But this coffee shop was the cherry on top.\n\nI especially loved the fact that it served Honduran coffee and kombucha on tap. Will definitely go back! Mmm, miel cortada!!!!\nBaristas here love their art!! We have nice conversations and I feel uplifted, special good vibes. Great coffee! They have a wide selection of kombucha at the Englewood location. The staff is friendly and I love the atmosphere for writing and studying."

Everything is labeled GF for gluten-free, which is so nice! We couldn\u2019t believe how many broth, meat, and veggie options there are. We will definitely be back to enjoy this hot pot again! This was my third time trying hot pot \ud83c\udf72 but my first time at this restaurant. I enjoyed the atmosphere. Service was good, and the food ingredients were all tasty. This is my favorite hot pot spot in the Denver metro area! The selection is extensive, the ingredients are always fresh, and the quality of the meats is impressive. It\u2019s my go-to place for celebrating Asian holidays with friends, and it never disappoints.\n\nPro tip: don\u2019t skip the milk tea with pudding for dessert\u2014it\u2019s always a highlight and the perfect sweet ending to a savory meal! Great selection of broths, sauces, meat and seafood for a hot pot place.  Tables were a bit sticky and sauce bar was kinda messy but we always leave super full and satisfied.  It\u2019s become a reliable standby place for us when we want reasonably priced but delicious hot pot. We went as a family to try first time this All You Can Eat hot pot place. It is quite spacious inside which accommodates large group like us. Friendly waitress who was quite attentive to add more broth and place additional orders when we needed to. There are also house made appetizers like seafood pancakes you can order in additional to the hot pot items. Meat variety is decent so is seafood, vegetable and noodles. Everything was also fresh. Unlike other hotpot places, they don\u2019t have ice creams but served a sweet dessert soup. I am sure this is a nice change for Asians who are used to this type of dessert but not sure whether others would prefer that. The restaurant should take this into consideration because I saw quite some tables of customers who were not Asian."

The menu included other interesting choices.\n\nService was excellent. It was fast, friendly and attentive. The space is small but attractive with several tables as well as seats at the bar. There are TVs on the walls. The place was very clean. They do have password protected Wi-Fi available on guests.\n\nParking was readily available on this visit, but may be more difficult at peak times. Holy smokes - this was the best pulled pork I\u2019ve ever had! Seasoned on the outside, fell apart in the best way, and the brisket was mouth watering delicious. Looking forward to visiting soon for their craft beer that they brew in house Super yummy. The staff was so nice i didn't even wanna take my order to go. The restaurant was clean and quaint. The food was super good, smokey and well seasoned. The sides were good, not as good as the meat but it was a welcomed balance. I didn't try the in house beers but you can tell they know what they're doing in that department as well. This is now a go to spot for me Friday lunch, loved the brisket and pulled pork platter. Wanted to try pork ribs but available only on 3rd Saturdays of the month. Good selection of beer on tap. Friendly staff. Will be going back for more. The overall atmosphere is really cool. Acoustics of the place seems to have found that perfect balance of being lively enough without being too loud (even with a full dining room and bar).\n\nFood and beer were excellent! Seems like the type of place you can't go wrong with whatever you order.\n\nReason for the 3 stars, though, is people being seated after us getting their entrees before us. Apparently the kitchen missed our order, which was frustrating. I'd definitely recommend you hire a server for the dining room. You have one person being the bartender and waiter for the entire dining room. Seems pretty ridiculous to operate that way."

    "reviews": "I am from Scotland. We have a large Indian population. I came to the USA in the 90\u2019s. I have been searching for a taste of home for over 30 years. I ordered the lamb Rogan Josh tonight and it brought me right back to my home in Dalkieth. Every Friday night we do takeout Indian from the chippie around the corner. The food from Star of India tastes like what I remember from my youth. Stopped in for the lunch buffet. There were lots of options and they seemed to be re-filling hot stations in small batches. Most of what I tried seemed to be at temperature although there were a couple items that were not. Love that the buffet is served with fresh prepared naan delivered to the table. Also had a couple cups of delicious chai tea which was wonderful on such a cold day. I also enjoyed that it was not sweetened so I could add if I wanted to. The tandoori chicken, chicken curry and saag were my favorites from this lunch but I'm always excited to be able to try different items that I wouldn't immediately order otherwise. Service was great and the restaurant itself was not overcrowded for lunchtime. We have loved coming here for almost 3 years now. Probably the best food in all of Colorado, and the NICEST staff ever. They are always warm and welcoming, and the food is consistently amazing. We have literally never had bad food or service in the several times we have been here and even friends and family love this place. I can\u2019t recommend Star of India enough. Truly a great restaurant and staff. Such a wonderful family business!! Very welcoming environment and the most delicious Indian food I have had in a long time! Gaurav was an excellent server \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffc The service was also outstanding here ; our server was very attentive and helpful, and he made several great recommendations. The restaurant had a warm and inviting atmosphere, making for a memorable dining experience.\"\nDelicious Food-  have become a big fan of the quality of the ingredients. Very fresh and aromatic. A must-try if you haven't already."

It's definitely on the quiet side, but I don't understand why more people don't go. One of our go tos The food was NOT good at all the fries were soggy and smelt freeze dried the poppers topping is so bland and the chili was like a petrified old can of Hormel chili New to this side of town. The owner was working tonight and she was very sweet. Took very good care of me and my girlfriend. Very glad we went there for the first time. They have pool and what I have heard good food too. Instead of going to those mainstream bars go check this place out for a classic Colorado vibe. They have pool and music. Even karaoke!! Definitely must visit for anyone new to the town! Bartender gave us one round of drinks then kept \u201cforgetting\u201d about my drink and would just walk by and never got it for me."

    "reviews": "This was my first time here, and I came in for the Sunday breakfast buffet and omelet bar. It was a fairly simple sampling of breakfast items, but everything was fantastic.  The omelet was the best one I've had in a long time, and they had a fantastic potato dish. All the food felt like I was in a fine dining restaurant or fancy hotel. Service was very attentive without feeling like the server was hovering and all the staff were extremely kind and polite.  I'll be bringing family and friends in the near future! My first time at this restaurant.  They had a band on a Friday night. There is a giant dance floor and the senior community filled it up.  I had the shrimp louie off the appetizer menu and shared a bottle of Pino Grigio with my friends.  Whenever i go back I will always order Shrimp Louie because it was delicious.  Prices are the best part. If I could give 10 stars- I would.  I was looking on the internet for a new place for Sunday breakfast.  I eat out quite a bit.  This place came up.  It so happens I know a few of the Security staff, so I figured I would check it out.  This is about 4 hours ago.  Out of the way/off the beaten path, so not crowded.  Excellent buffet for $16.50 before tip.  Custom omelets, fresh fruit, big yummy bacon, potatoes, all in big piles, fresh, ripe, crispy and hot.  Marty behind the buffet tables was a great face for your place.  See you next Sunday!!!! Our garden club had our annual holiday lucheon there.  Good food, quiet place, they had everything nice  clean and set up for us when we got there.  Pleasant to work with. The bartender Ryan is the best! They have something going on everyday! Love it here!\ud83e\udd70"

I was able to place my order on a touch screen so I could make changes without having to have a discussion about it  It was nice. The touch acreen was easy to work and had scrolling options like my phone. I could also delete items easily.\nThis location has the drink machines with the fun flavors of drinks. I LOVE these machines. I get the mixed up drinks I used to get as a kid.\nI waa handed my correct order with napkins, condiments and supplies for my frosties.\nIm very pleased with my visit. Wow, we are always amazed at just how awesome the staff is at our neighborhood Wendy\u2019s! Regardless of how busy they are, how rude the people before us were, these people really shine. They work hard to consistently make tasty, fresh, and hot food. Any time that an honest mistake has ever been made on our order, the staff corrects with a smile and an apology.   Very thankful for these fine folks! As far as Wendy's go, this is a very good location. It seems to be well-managed and they have got my orders correct so far. The restaurant is clean, and due to the homeless population requires a code to get into the restrooms. There is easy access off of I-225 and Parker Road. I went to try the Son of the Baconator for $3.  The meat was dry and chewy.  The cheese wasn\u2019t cooked, and a little cold and unmelted.  The bacon was ok.\n\nA few hours after eating around 4 am, dear reader, and as I write this, I awoke to diarrhea and stomach cramps.  While whether this was caused necessarily by Wendy\u2019s bad burger is up in the air, I do feel this was the cause.\n\nI will not be back. Humans did a great job no complaints there. But this AI taking my order? Horrible. I just got home to realize it got 2 of my three items wrong. Very frustrating and not a good machine. Would much rather just tell a human who\u2019s standing there."

YUUUUUUUCK!\nMy girlfriend and I recently visited the night that the Walker Williams Band was playing. This \u201cvenue\u201d is nothing more than 1 or 2 storefronts in a strip mall with a bar on the top level (2-3 steps). You can imagine how the music sounds with strip-mall acoustics.\nOn to the food. Yuuuuuuuuck!\nWe ordered a small cheese pizza and a side of garlic bread with two sodas. The pizza came out, and didn\u2019t even cover the metal pie pan that it was served on! There wasn\u2019t any noticeable raised crust on the edge and the pizza, in entirety, was under baked. The sauce had no discernible flavor to it. The entire pizza was covered with cheese even though we asked for \u201cvery light cheese\u201d on half of it. The pizza didn\u2019t come out that way and had no flavor to it. It was one of the three worst pies I have ever tried, and I love pizza.\nAs for the \u201cgarlic\u201d bread, we were served four pieces of what appeared to be halves of two sandwich rolls cut in half and laid on a warm flat-top. As far as cooking the garlic bread, there appeared to be slight discoloration from the heat of the griddle. No discernible butter flavor OR GARLIC FLAVOR. Yuuuuuuuuck!\nWe also ordered two sodas at $3.50 each. What a deal, especially when my Sprite got low. The attentive waitress was kind enough to refill it with water instead of Sprite. Apparently, it\u2019s one-and-done with expensive sodas.\nNEVER, EVER, AGAIN! Love the employees and the food at Hero's! Dave and Michelle do an excellent job making this place feel like home, and help the Veterans and the community.  Try the pizza rolls or the chicken fried steak! Shelly is always on it with your favorite beverage, so stop in and stay awhile \ud83d\ude03 Ordered from here via Slice. Pizza (pepperoni w/extra cheese) was probably the worst pizza I have ever tried. Burger was very bland. The Brownie \"a la mode\" was just a brownie with icing on it. Paid $3 for a fountain drink cup that is slightly smaller than a solo cup.\nCouldn't even finish the food and ended up placing an order for food from a new restaurant instead. $39 down the drain. This is unacceptable. Not only was it cold when it showed up but it\u2019s also burnt. Never ordering here again."

I don't know maybe if I have nothing else to do I haven't had any food here, but I come in occasionally for drinks. Bee is really nice and attentive. The bar looks nice and clean. I haven't seen it bustling busy here, but that might also be because I tend to wander in late. I have to try a time closer happy hour."

It was a little louder but the place is small on the inside so don't go with first date intentions to get to know the person you are with but do go if you want to just enjoy the people around you and have some yummy food! Chicken breast tenders are so good, patty Melt was delicious and the bacon wrapped jalape\u00f1o poppers are a new twist to an old appetizer. If you haven't been don't sleep on this spot. This place is a hidden gem! The staff is super friendly and the food is delicious. We tried the chicken and waffles and the BLT, and the BLT was absolutely amazing. It\u2019s the perfect spot for a relaxing brunch. Highly recommend it! First visit but surely will not be my last!  Seems like everyone here knows someone or is family!  Super friendly atmosphere and outstanding service. Our bartender Rachel, was alone on duty on Christmas Eve until the troops rallied and other employees showed up on thi exceptionally busy holiday eve!\nWe got the best ever chicken sandwich and salad was fresh and plentiful.\nEveryone was happy and enjoying a great time!  Don't miss this hidden gem with great views and fantastic decorations!0 Front Range Inn is a solid spot for good food and a relaxed vibe. The wings are definitely the standout\u2014crispy, flavorful, and with a great variety of sauces to choose from. The draft beer selection is on point, with plenty of options to pair with your meal.\n\nFries are fantastic.\n\nThe atmosphere is exactly what you want in a tavern\u2014casual, friendly, and a great place to hang out with friends. Whether you\u2019re stopping in for a quick bite or a few drinks, it\u2019s a great local spot to kick back and enjoy! Don\u2019t let the outside fool you, this place is more than just a dive bar. The food is shockingly good. Had some sort of fusion Korean-Nashville hot chicken sandwich that was whipped up by the house chef from scratch and it was mind blowing. Staff was great too. The inside feels like a cross between the pizza parlor scene at the beginning of ET abd the bar in Tatoienne Obi-Wan takes Luke Skywalker too."

All of the staff was friendly and attentive.\nOur food was delicious and the atmosphere is warm and comfortable.\nWe will return for another flavorful meal.\nThank you! This was a great night! Staff was superb and the food was amazing. However, the bar was pretty small and it was pretty loud inside. Definitely we will try to make a reservation for the patio next time. Can\u2019t wait to go back, though! We went for our anniversary, and the staff surprised us with champagne! Thanks for helping celebrate with us :)\n\nMy husband is a chef, and raved about the conchigele(?) with salmon and smoked Gouda cream. Lunch was amazing on the patio. Great service, food was excellent. First time for me & I will go back. This is  a fantastic restaurant in every way. We had a party of 12 and sat on the enclosed patio. The atmosphere was perfect for our celebration.  Our server, Matt, was phenomenal. He made great recommendations and was super personable.  The owner came by our table to check on us, and  we couldn\u2019t say enough about how great our experience was. Our party of 12 ordered a variety of dishes and everything was delicious. There was not a single bad meal in the group. We unanimously agreed it was the best restaurant we have been to in Denver. Highly recommend! I recently visited Colore and had an incredible experience thanks to Marley. From the moment I arrived, her warmth and professionalism stood out. Marley was attentive, friendly, and had excellent recommendations, which made my visit even more enjoyable.\n\nI decided to try the spiked strawberry lemonade, and it was absolutely delicious. The drink was perfectly balanced, with the right amount of sweetness and a refreshing kick. Marley\u2019s suggestion was spot-on, and I\u2019m so glad I took her advice.\n\nHer exceptional service and knowledge made my time at Colore unforgettable. I\u2019ll definitely be back and highly recommend asking for Marley when you visit!"

Parking was good. The shop wasn't busy. It was expensive for a dozen donuts. With tradition at ANY donut shop they would give a \"bakers dozen.\" The donuts were dry and the filings were as well. We hope they improve the quality of their donuts. I had a disappointing experience at this Dunkin' drive-thru. The employee, Gracie, was extremely rude, unwelcoming, and curt. From the moment I spoke to her, she gave off a negative energy that made me feel uncomfortable. It was the first interaction of my morning, and unfortunately, it set a very unpleasant tone for my entire visit. When I had an issue with my order, Gracie's lack of professionalism became even more evident. She interrupted her coworker, Denzel, as he tried to assist me with correcting the mistake. Both employees were defensive and unhelpful, and neither of them had name tags. Customer service training is clearly needed for both of them. I truly hope Gracie isn't in a leadership role, as her attitude doesn't reflect well on the business. I\u2019ll definitely be reconsidering ordering from Dunkin' again.\n\nI DO NOT recommend this Dunkin' donuts location! This location in Lakewood is absolutely the worst. They never have the omelette bite and quite honestly the people that work for them are really nasty. I can\u2019t even give them one star they should fire everyone and start again. Horrible story horrible. Drive through staff aren't with energetic bubbly smiles today... They are\ud83e\udd76\nI would have definitely given them a five star but the attitude of the server and cashier was obvious because I had ordered at the speaker a hot macchiato with carmel and then when I approached the window, the person was beginning to hand an iced macchiato to me, and I had to correct the situation and advise her it was a hot macchiato\n\nThe person at the window looks mad like she/he needs to takes a breath and as the person is walking away the person says aloud frowning, she did not hear me say that while using a firm tone; however,  it's not that I wouldn't have taken it it's just that I was ordering for the person in the backseat who just had come from the dentist and they had been out in the cold and they needed something hot.\n\nI hope the next time that I go back to Dunkin' donuts that the ones that were serving the public understand that their facial expressions and tones do matter and it's kind of scary because we are in the car, the drive through will never know if a person like that to catch a real attitude and go make our coffee and possibly be spitting in the coffee or doing something that could cause somebody to have diarrhea... Feel better staff at the window."

With plenty of different attractions throughout the week, including trivia and open mic, almost anytime is a good time to stop in for some food and drinks. It was my 3rd time visiting this time around and I feel like I'll continue to support. Pizza was delicious, I decided to order two 18\" pizzas to go! I have been coming here for years for the food.  Stopped in a couple days ago.  New owner, and staff.  Menu changed it's now more like bar food and only had a couple Italian items.  Had the lasagna not as good as it looked and super cold in the middle.  Disappointed.   Husband had the fish n chips, looked great, tasted ok, but malt vinegar bottle had dead flies floating on the bottom, we told the new bartender Riley and she tried to get a new bottle that wasn't dirty.  Riley was awesome,  upbeat, and did comp us two drinks for the yucky malt vinegar trying to rectify the situation.   Needless to say, food is not even close as good it used to be, and prices have gone way up on both food and drinks.   I'm not sure I'll be back. I really like how the new owner has renewed the place\nThe food is much better now and the service is absolutely better.\nI would recommend the fish and chips and pizza to anyone!\nIf you're looking for a great bar with great food and weekly activites like trivia on Thursday night, definitely try these guys out!!\n\n:) Not what I expected, when we walked in. But, give it a shot. The cheese bread with spicy sauce is great. Must get the fried ravioli. The lasagna, and calzone are incredible. The deserts are okay. But the service was awesome and if you are lucky....the bar tender will tell you Chuck Norris jokes. Love it. I will be back! It was a busy Friday evening, and their kitchen staff struggled to keep up. The crew did a super job letting us know about the waiting time.\n\nThis used to be the neighborhood spot. It has been 20 years since I stopped by. I am not 100% sure if it is still the same joint, but it doesn't disappoint!\n\nThe food is great, almost too good for the price.\nTry the meatball spaghetti, bruschetta! You won't regret it...

Ample seating, solid playlist, super friendly staff. My wife and I enjoyed their impressive drink selection and I had some tasty tacos while we played a classic board game from their selection. If we lived in Denver I think we would be here often. Coming off a three day bender, there\u2019s nothing like running some pickleball with the squad and hitting a brewery after. Or so we thought\u2026\n\nBang! Crash! Aooga! What the h?!? As we enjoyed our tasty beers, ciders, and margaritas outside on the deck, it began storming like all get out! Cars flipped over, buildings collapsed, old ladies got flung into the air (not really, I\u2019m just a pathological liar).\n\nThe service was excellent and the drinks were tasty. To give you an idea, they were literally so good, that we went from \u201cI\u2019m not going to drink today\u201d to \u201cdude, do we make it a four day bender\u201d after just two drinks here. Spoiler alert, we did.\n\nFour stars because duck fries were a bit soggy. But the sauces were great! I have frequented this establishment for the past few days while in town on business. I was quite pleased with attentive service and friendly staff. The patio is a nice place to relax after a long day indoors.\n\nI would recommend the fries that are cooked with duck fat, as well as the chicken pesto sandwich. In fact, all the food I had was very well prepared.\n\nAll in all, a great experience. I will be returning in the future. Denver weather can be wild! It's official. This is my new spot! Found this place while on vacation, and I can't wait to go back.  Food is very tasty, and the customer service was Top Notch.\nPro Tip: Ask for Mary, she is the best! She is very knowledgeable and friendly she gave us great beer and food recommendations!\nWe have had The Venga, Rocky Mt lager, the Buzz honey, and the Imperial Stout. Loved them.\nI absolutely love the fact that they had non-alcoholic offerings.\nThis is my new go-to spot for sure. I almost decided to stop here for dinner, but in the end, I'm so glad I didn't.\n\nHow would I be able to enjoy delicious food and beer when there's too many babies and kids around.\n\nI'm saying some people want to relax while having delicious food and beer and can't because of the screaming and screeching.\n\nHowever, the doggies were adorable to see. The whole place could be full of dogs, and that wouldn't bother me."

He even started calling my friend by their preferred name after figuring out it was different from their legal one, which is a step most people don't take and was definitely appreciated by all of us.

    "reviews": "I can't believe we've never been here. We got take out, beef and broccoli, moo shu chicken, chicken fried rice, they have it all, and it was all good. I think we found our new Chinese restaurant! I was visiting my mom, who was in the hospital nearby, and I needed dinner, so I decided on this place.\n\nThe food was great and there's a lot of choices which were amazing.\n\nThey had happy hour prices from 4 pm to 6 pm.\n\nI had spring vegetable spring rolls, Poison Ivy Roll, and Philadelphia Roll.\nAll very delicious!\n\nI had a drink, but it was very weak and super sweet. Wow!!! I wish I could give more than 5 stars for this place- everything was amazing! Atmosphere, service, food, and wait time was exceptional. Kevin took care of us and was very attentive and kind. We will definitely be back! Stopped by for a quick lunch. Andy and the staff are always friendly and attentive. You can tell they pay attention to details. The food hits the spot every time! UPDATE: Adding some new pictures of green curry cod, calamari, salmon, crab cake, lobster shrimp fried rice, and green beans and eggplant. SOOO GOOD. Full of flavor and deliciousness.\n\nPrice: Very fair. You are getting all that and then some.\n\nFood: From wait time, to presentation, to taste\u2026super flavorful, I\u2019m always so excited to eat here lol\n\nTheir catering options are incredible too. Check out the pictures of the sashimi boats. I don\u2019t eat sashimi but seeing how pretty it was, I almost wish I did lol.\n\nService: Everyone is so family oriented here. You get treated like you\u2019re a part of the fam as well. Everytime I come here, I see regulars come in and can feel the warmth from the staff.\n\nEnvironment: Dinning area, bar area with seating, sushi bar with seating. Not the biggest inside but plenty of room.\n\nNTT [[Next Time Try]]: EVERYTHING. That\u2019s it. That\u2019s all. Eat everything. Lol.\n\nYou can catch me here everytime I\u2019m in Denver. #iLoveItHere"

    "reviews": "This is a fairly small, but popular place. Normally, I prefer black coffee to flavored coffee drinks but the bananas foster espresso drink sounded interesting. It did live up to the name delivering on the banana flavor. If you're a fan of flavored coffees there are a lot of choices here. There are also good unflavored coffees. There is a selection of sandwiches, chips, cookies and pastries. The Harvard breakfast panino was very good with ham, cheese, egg and guacamole. Just the right size too. There is also wine and beer available and a pear cider that looked interesting.\n\nThe staff was very friendly and helpful even though it was pretty busy. The space was comfortable to sit with my coffee and sandwich.\n\nThere is a dedicated parking area behind the building which is accessed from the alley off E Wesley Ave. Although busy, there was adequate parking available; it seems like a lot of the traffic is walk-in from the University. Always enjoy this quaint cafe every time I am in town. Great coffee, teas, pastries and if you are on the go they have the most delicious wraps. Also a nice spot to wind down with wine and cheese. Scott and Rebecca (and Jordan) are absolutely phenomenal! This place is THE best. The people I mentioned are so sweet and welcoming and just kind human beings. Great selection of pastries and food and drinks too I\u2019d highly recommend checking this place out!! Great atmosphere in an out of the way little coffee shop. Nice break from the busy of the city. Went in this morning to grab breakfast before work, I should have been going here since I moved! The guy making coffee was so nice and so was the blonde lady at the counter. Almond Joy espresso & I had to try \u201cThe Ohio\u201d because thats where I\u2019m from. It did not dissapoint, I can\u2019t wait to try more. Delicious, fast and considerate! Edit: Been coming here over a year now and all of the baristas are so sweet and everything I\u2019ve had is delicious."

Worst most disgusting food delivery mistake. The chicken shawarma pita didn't have the toppings it claimed and was so grisly we couldn't bite into it, pita was dry and gross, falafel rubbery, the hummus, tzakiki, and baba watery and flavorless, the entire bag had our orders of pickles spilled and missing turnips and the veggie combo all scrambled in a container. I'm afraid of us getting sick. My brother and I came to Chez Ali for lunch and had an unbelievable meal. The chicken shawarma was the best I\u2019ve had and everything from the lamb to the grape leaves and falafel was cooked to perfection. A wonderful experience!!"

Before I was out of there, the bartender was there to fix it.. great, except it didn't dawn on me at the time (too busy chatting) that she hadn't washed her hands before going back to the bar, holding a glass up to the dim light and pouring my wine. I had 2+ glasses of wine. Next day, I woke up SOOO SICK \ud83d\ude2b Felt like the inside of my mouth and throat had been chemically burned, and looked like it. 3 days of nothing but milk. I'm not saying it is from Sean's.. just a very strange coincidence to get that type of ill after 2 glasses of wine \ud83e\udee0 I came here for the wings, and this was the right place to get them! They were yummy, perfectly done, and the atmosphere was much nicer than so many other places. Donna took great care of me. Super friendly place with very affordable food and drink options. The place has 2 pool tables, and a bunch of TV's for sports. Decent amount of tables and space to move around. Plus a gated patio. I am new to the area and wanted to try Sean's Tavern out, it's just what I like. Great bar tender."

    "reviews": "Excellent hot wings! Great french fries! It's a bar, so it's loud. Other than that, we will DEFINITELY be back!\nWe visited again! Super good folks. If you love hot wings, don't pass this place up! Sizable and crispy wings, great vibes, lots of TVs. The Chinese chicken wings (medium) were as good as any I\u2019ve had in the Denver metro with the dry rub right behind, buffalo a close third, gotta try em all. Coupla Guinnesses for St Patty\u2019s. Piper Inn feels like an institution, and I can see why It's probably some of the best chicken wings in Denver.  The wings are large, and if you ask, they'll make them crispy.  The Garlic parm are a must try.  I would love it if they one day offer a lemon pepper dry rub. I can't be the only one who's asked, right ?. At first I was concerned over the high price of their wings but to be honest, the cost is worth it. No wonder everyone says their wings are the best in CO. Crispy, flavorful and their side portions are well worth the price. I highly recommend the garlic parm and Chinese wings. It\u2019s obvious this place has lots of repeat customers. The vibe is comfortable for sure. Our server was awesome. Busy. But took care of us. Good took some time. When it arrived fries were cold. Wings overcooked (dry) crispy and crunchy to the bone. Flavor was good. Maybe it was an off night. Wasn\u2019t the worst meal I had AND it would take some arm wrestling for me to drop another $50 for that food."

The chicken kebab was great and though they were out of eggplant when we visited, the hummus tasted very good. Lots of tables and seats inside the restaurant, with free but somewhat hard to find parking, as the lot is shared with several other businesses in the same shipping plaza. Overall a great experience. Recommended! Authentic Yemeni Experience A Hidden Gem!\n\nYemen Grill delivers an unforgettable and truly authentic Yemeni dining experience. From the moment you arrive, you\u2019re greeted with warm smiles and genuine hospitality from the staff, making you feel right at home. The atmosphere is cozy and culturally rich, setting the perfect backdrop for the meal.\n\nThe food is absolutely incredible packed with deep, traditional flavors, and the meat is so tender it falls right off the bone. Every dish reflects the care and authenticity of true Yemeni cooking. Whether you\u2019re familiar with the cuisine or trying it for the first time, this place is a must-visit. Highly recommended for anyone seeking a delicious and welcoming experience! This was my first time here, and I was really impressed! The service was excellent\u2014friendly, attentive, and fast. The food was delicious and came out hot and fresh. On top of that, the prices were very reasonable for the quality. I\u2019ll definitely be coming back! Absolutely Amazing Experience at Yemen Grill!\nWe came all the way from Texas and were blown away by the hospitality and service at Yemen Grill. The staff was incredibly welcoming and made us feel right at home. The food was authentic and delicious, and to top it all off\u2014they surprised me with a free dessert! You don\u2019t find that kind of generosity everywhere. If you\u2019re in the area, do yourself a favor and check them out ASAP. 10/10 highly recommend! The owner is super nice, and the food is insanely good! I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever had Middle Eastern food this delicious\u2014the flavors were on point, and the service was awesome. If you\u2019re in Denver, you have to try Yemen Grill. The lamb, mango smoothies, and chicken are next-level. Plus, the place just feels really cozy and welcoming."

    "reviews": "It was absolutely crazy and so busy but the workers especially one shorter lady with natural colored red hair  kept it all going literally running back and forth and communicating frequently with the customers waiting to make sure every knew she was getting to them. She made the wait not terrible and kept the customers happy and everyone got what they ordered:) I ordered the pistachio latte and asked what the toppings would be I was told just whipped cream and caramel after getting my order there was some form of cookie type toppings so I went inside to clarify what was in it because I have celiac and cannot have gluten they assured me it was fine nothing to worry about but I called another store to double check and it in fact does contain wheat. I would have paid for another drink because I really just wanted a coffee and could have gotten extremely sick. I wish they would have taken the two seconds to actually check and tell me that it had gluten/wheat. Good donuts but the order isn't always correct. I've been given Boston cream instead of Bavarian cream sometimes. The avocado toast is very good and the coffee is hot. The drive through is always slow. I had the best experience I have ever had with Dunkin! Selene, is the best. She went above and beyond on service and my drinks were made amazing. I will be returning, for someone that has worked as a barista for years I could say we would love to have her on our team. She made my experience unforgettable. This is now going to be where I go every single morning. Thank you Selene, thanks for all the kindness as well. You are amazing! The only negative thing this morning was that although they\u2019re still called apple fritters, they\u2019re not. What used to be fritters are now just apple filled donuts and very little apple at that. Went back yesterday for the $6 Meal Deal (egg, sausage, cheese on croissant, medium coffee, 6 hash browns). It was disgusting! Also got a box of 10 donut holes. The jelly ones literally had nothing inside. Looks like they just touched the hole with jelly to make it look like it was filled."

    "reviews": "New favorite spot for sure. Everything was on point: the atmosphere, the service, and the food. The tuna and the smoked salmon sushi were super fresh and tasty, the karaage was crispy perfection, and the matcha tiramisu totally blew us away. Expensive, but for the quality we were surprised about how much of a deal it seemed. Angelina our server was excellent. The restaurant remarkably well done. Food not so much.  Had edamame which was spiced however not much flavor.  Ordered yakosobe (sp) and it was covered with a sauce that looked like mayo.  I never knew this dish to be creamy.  Ordered a few Akers from the grill which were only a meat or fish. Ok.\nI won\u2019t go back despite the wonderful presentation and service First visit and I absolutely will be back with my family next time. The food is delicious \ud83e\udd24 service is fantastic and the atmosphere is amazing. We were there during happy hour which was great! Still a little pricier than I was expecting but the quality is outstanding It was our first time trying this place out as we celebrated my fiances birthday. They definitely gained two new frequent customers from us. The decor and ambiance were fenomenal making it seem like you were in japan and they even had a cute photo shoot room by the bathroom for selfies.The menu has a large selection and even a happy hour option if you come at the right time. We had a little of everything, including the sashimi combo, kumamoto oysters, pork cutlet bento box, and the kara-age. Everything was mouth-watering and fresh with healthy portions to each dish. My fiance even ordered a second helping of the sashimi as it just melted in your mouth. They also have a huge drink menu, and their cocktails are well balanced with amazing flavors. Mendee, our server, was also amazing throughout our stay. He was attentive and gave us amazing recommendations, answering every question we had with efficiency. We'll definitely be coming back here again! What a great find! Hang on to this-My recent dining experience at Leezakaya, a newly opened Asian restaurant that quickly exceeded my expectations. From the moment we stepped inside, the unique atmosphere\u2014a harmonious blend of modern elegance and traditional Asian decor\u2014set the perfect tone for the evening.\n\nWe went during happy hour and were happily surprised by the extensive menu. I couldn't resist trying their signature sushi rolls and the shrimp tempura, both bursting with flavor and freshness. The standout for me was the spicy tuna roll and yellow tail; it was an explosion of taste that kept me coming back for more. Keep in mind the menus has something for everyone.\n\nThe staff was incredibly welcoming, and the sushi bar would yell an Asian welcome to everyone that entered the restaurant! Their passion for the food was evident and added a personal touch that made the evening even more enjoyable.\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for a new culinary adventure, Leezakaya should be at the top of your list. The combination of delicious food, a vibrant atmosphere, and attentive service makes it a must-visit. Don\u2019t miss out on this gem\u2014\nAs you know.. if it\u2019s great, we be in there!"

The menu was simple, we ordered the special soup - food came out quickly and it was delicious. It was definitely enough portion for 2 people. Came here since 2016/2017? And then they closed down for about two years and now have been back.  Taste hasnt changed. Still managed by same owners from kitchen to the front of the house.  True soul food. Their gookbap came back!!!! I was so excites when their gookbap came back. Its the best. The broth is so rich and delicious. The kimchi is so good too. Will be visiting often! Great place to get together.  Large open space, karaoke room, and great food.  I'm not going to fault them for missing one of our orders, as we ordered a lot and we understood that it was hard to keep track.\n\nSoldier stew was delicious. One of the best meals I\u2019ve had in a long time. Excellent service, delicious food and warm ambiance. 10 of 10 recommend. The bulgogi beef was outstanding."

    "reviews": "Don't walk, run! This is one of the best restaurants I have eaten at in my 4 years of living here. Female chef deserves all the love, her dishes are 1000/10. Will come back time and time again! Thank you for being here, we love Bettola! When we first stepped inside I was expecting exactly the name Bettola in Italian suggests \u201cshady, trashy joint or hole\u201d because of the location. However, walking in we were greeted by the bar manager and immediately felt how cozy and warm the place was with very few seating options which lured us to the bar as reservations filled the rest of the tables.\n\nI am so happy we did stay. You will not get a better experience if you don\u2019t pick the barkeeps brain a little. Johnson is very experienced in his field and has incredible knowledge about so much in the industry. Just listen a while.\n\nDrinks that were recommended given our taste were hand crafted to perfection and never had I had such refreshing and delicate drinks that paired exceptionally with our meals. To start I ordered a Red 75 and with dessert a Lime Cello. The freshest bread at the perfect temperature was set in front of us alongside oil with balsamic vinegar. That alone felt like a delicacy. I requested the short rib lasagna special and the nostalgia in me was so happy I did. It truly felt like the moment the critic from ratatouille bit into the ratatouille and I was flooded with warm memories of my grandmother\u2019s lasagna growing up. Chef is truly exceptional and has won me over the most upscale experience. Every single dish is hand crafted on order not scooped from a pan sitting under warmers. Dessert was an 8 layer honey cake that I have yet to stop thinking about, so much that they did say an entire cake can be prepared for sale if given a 3 day notice. Imagine cheesecake and honey teddy grahams it the most decadent way.\n\nI will be ordering a cake and I will be going back to just have that experience of a \u2018welcome back\u2019 conversation in a low lit, quaint, little hole-in-the-wall that makes me feel like I can lose track of time and escape away from the mundane the weeks carry. Absolutely delightful hole in the wall bistro!!! Everything made from scratch! Mussels were to die for! Salmon pesto was succulent! And hose special was spinach stuffed ravioli with house ricotta, in a vodka sauce \ud83d\ude0b with their fresh greens!, My daughter enjoyed their signature award winning Limoncelo, and we enjoyed topping off the meal with a salted caramel chocolate Gelato. DECADENT. Dinner with my colleague\nFood is good  almost authentic to be in US\nMy cioppino was good ... but too much mussel and clams and not so much other seefood or fish ... for 40 usd I was aspecting also Calamari scallops and more shrimps\nPasta of my colleague looks good and the burrata was good\nLocation can be little better they should clean up outside and change some old staff I stopped by to eat here the other day and absolutely loved the experience from start to finish. The staff was incredibly welcoming, friendly, and knowledgeable about every dish and ingredient, which made the whole visit feel even more special. I was lucky enough to sample a few different menu items, and honestly, every bite was delicious. You can really taste the care and creativity that goes into the food. Highly recommend checking this place out\u2014you won\u2019t be disappointed!"

    "reviews": "Went here for my birthday party this year and the food was pretty good. The service was amazing! The server captured almost the whole group of us as we sat in the back. It was great. There's enough space even when parties are gathering around people are still able to hear each other. The fried crab is not fresh, sushi is so so, other food is about average level just like other buffet place. BBQ is good. The waitress is not monitoring her tables well, bringing receipt while I was still eating. When I went to get my last dish for fruits, she cleaned the table and brought others there, kind of rude. Bad. Don't go. Limited options, food sat out too long, and EVERYTHING was sticky. The floor was so sticky my shoe got stuck and came half off. Gross The first time we came, it was very good- the second time, not so much. It's very overpriced- 55 dollars for 1 adult & a child buffet, with 2 teas. No one ate 55 worth of food. The bathrooms are very gross!! Like the last bathroom stall has been full of \ud83d\udca9, even after a month, and they still haven't fixed it. They do have a huge selection of different foods & sushi. This was my first time going with my family. We should have just listened to others after reading reviews but we always try to give restaurants the benefit & try it out because if not (how will you ever know). The food was ehhhh. I feel like dollar scoops are better. Don\u2019t even get me started on the waiters/waitress. RUDE RUDE RUDE! This gal we had literally had NO emotions and when she came to give us a refill of water she split the water on the table the back to front of the table & did not clean it up. In one of our cups, there was something nasty left on there (see pic) told the front staff & owner & was told they couldn\u2019t do anything or give a discount but offered just a new cup!!!!! Owner is screaming from the back across the whole restaurant SMH! the only thing that was \u201cdecent\u201d was the hibachi station & the cook that night. Overall this place only gets a 1star just because of the hibachi station. They fool you with the crab but the legs are SMALL & they are greedy, they only bring a small batch out at a time! If you like Asian buffets, take your drive to Arvada & go to KING BUFFET! Hands down 100000000% BETTER! oh also they don\u2019t display it on their menu but it\u2019s just about $3 for soft drinks. Do yourself a favor & AVOID this place if you want good food for your bucks!!"

We ordered the spicy braised ribs \ub9e4\uc6b4 \uac08\ube44\ucc1c and some cold noodles \ub0c9\uba74.\n\nWe shared both dishes and it was pretty phenomenal. \ub0c9\uba74 was very fresh and clean, sweet refreshing taste. Very cooling and not bland. The \uac08\ube44\ucc1c was moderately spicy to me but pretty spicy to my friend.  Also a bit on the sweeter side, spicy, not too salty, great veggies, and the ribs were pretty tender. All in all a delicious treat.\n\nBiggest down side is price, the ribs alone were $75 but we felt like treating ourselves so it was worth it. We both ate and we had about a serving of leftovers that reheats well. The food is great and the service is amazing! The portions are very filling. The prices are not the cheapest but it's high quality food so it's worth it. If you're craving Korean food, this place has some of the best Korean food in Denver. I highly recommend the soups here. There's many items on the menu so there's something for everyone. This is where you want to come and enjoy the excellent hot soup on a cold winter evening. Their beefy soup is out of this world. Everything we tried were filled with great flavor. I like the Mushroom Guk Bap in particular. The generous portion of mushroom helped bringing out the flavor of the soup stock.  Come here with an empty stomach and I am sure your tummy will appreciate a great deal at the end A gem for really good and hearty Korean soups. They were one of the firsts in the area to bring galbi jjim (spicy short rib with cheese) here. It\u2019s also good, but try out their other soups too. So many great ones. Galbi tang (short rib soup) and seolleongtang (brisket) gives pho a run for its money for hangovers. You\u2019re going to have to salt and pepper it to taste. So please don\u2019t think it\u2019s bland. I\u2019ll show you some examples in pics. Also try out bossam (boiled pork belly). Their bibim naengmyeon (cold buckwheat noodle) is also really good. The sauce was so good I had to dip my pork in it. Enjoy! Stopped in for lunch on a Saturday. Ordered a buchujeon, hae naengmyeon, and wang galbitang. Banchan was all delicious and went especially well with the chive pancake. Cold noodles were perfect for the day and the galbitang was spectacular. Will definitely be back!"

I believe the Hooters grilled chicken sandwich is perhaps one of the best in the US.   Hooters isn\u2019t what they used to be, in terms of service and cleanliness.\n\nMy first in store visit to this location. I stood for a while before being acknowledged.

Happy I stopped by, the beers were ice cold, the girls were cute, and the wings came out crispy and fresh, and drenched in the amazing sauces they have, I would highly recommend stopping by if your in the area, I got the classic spicy garlic buffalo wings and the other person I was with got the ghost pepper boneless wings, great food and service *edit they need to make sure they pay attention to food quality coming out i originally left a 4 stars , for the food quality and service, but after the 2nd visit a small handful of months later the food wasn't so great, I want my wings hot and fresh. Not warm and mushy, management should be keeping a better eye on food control* Oooops! Finally i am here!\nAnd its was insane delicious!\nWings! Shrimps!\nReally good!\nBuffalo honey and Daytona beach highly recommend! Seriously Awesome! Tonight was so busy but Emily was amazing. My fault for showing up on a fight night, but I\u2019m so impressed with how well she managed. Everyone else was good too, and the food was great as usual, but dang, I think I\u2019m in love."

    "reviews": "We were looking for a chill bar with food & pool tables. This place is exactly what we wanted. The atmosphere is really comfortable, chill, relaxed. They have 3 pool tables, several bar tops & a full bar. They also had my fave: pickle shots, both vodka & tequila based & a good variety of food on the menu. The prices are fair. The music was on point. Our waitress Ty was ON IT. She's friendly & was running all over the place keeping everyone happy. We'll definitely be back. The only reason that service is getting a three is because of the gentlemen that helped us on 4/11 otherwise there would\u2019ve been nothing positive to say. Otherwise, the experience was terrible. My partner and I came in just to get a few drinks and some wings. We walked inside the restaurant at 5:09 exactly. We waited at our table with two female waiters watching us for a good 20 minutes before we were even \u201cgreeted\u201d. We paid for pool even though the waiter came over and said that it was supposed to be open and free the whole time.\nWe finally got to ordered drinks, we ordered our food at the same time. About 15 minutes after a couple walked in, two chairs down on the open ended table along with us. They received their food and drinks before us, finally we said \u201clet\u2019s wait 10 more minutes and if the food doesn\u2019t arrive we will leave\u201d ten minutes later. An hour being in the restaurant. We decided to leave because our food still hadn\u2019t come.\n\nWe get it. It\u2019s a sports bar. Open seating, but when someone has seen and acknowledged you and still doesn\u2019t come to help and you\u2019re watching the people next to you eat their meal after you\u2019ve already ordered it gets a little frustrating.\n\nIt believe it or not felt very racially charged that everyone except for us were catered to.\n\nAs much as we love a good happy hour, we will not be returning. It was an overall good experience..besides being told its a 6 $ fee just for one player it was overall really relaxed and I just want to say that I would give it a 7 out of 10 on the rating due to some aspects that I won't go into to much detail..but over all had a good decent time. While the food tasted incredibly good, it came out from the kitchen incredibly slow. The server did what he could, however, the kitchen service has issues. Definitely jump in there if you're looking for some females without having to go downtown check the spot out got plenty of people in there it gets popping you'll have a good time you'll have some good drinks I never had the food"

    "reviews": "Miraim & Carmenza we're great and provided excellent service. I would recommend them two ladies (I'm pointing to him right there:) I can\u2019t tell you how the food was because I left before I could eat it. The manager, Junior, refused to serve some young lady and was screaming at her. He was so rude I couldn\u2019t even believe my ears. Truly, I was flabbergasted that any human, let alone a MANAGER, would say the things that he did to her. Very personal things that were horrific. He was so disrespectful, aggressive and demeaning that I was scared for her. When she ordered, he was rude to her and when she asked for his name, he lost his mind. That\u2019s when things got out so out of control, another customer told him to quiet down and leave the young lady alone. How this man is still employed is mind boggling. He is a walking lawsuit. Could have been five stars but food was out a temp and customer service was mid. She never greeted, just straight to \"what did I want\" and it wasn't even busy. She didn't wash her hands in between the last customer, preparing my food & touching money back to the food station. She just kept the same nasty gloves on to do everything.\ud83d\ude33\ud83e\udd2e\ud83e\udd22\nNo atmosphere, awkwardly quiet everybody can hear everybody's conversations. Put some light jazz on or something! Used a card I got from a catering and the staff acted mad about it. The cashier was touching the inside of my lid with her bare hands and when I asked for a new lid she got mad and threw it in the trash very aggressively and then threw the lid at me and walked off! Very unprofessional and very rude! If I could give this restaurant a -10 stars I would. I placed my order on Uber eats whenever my driver arrived they told him that they already gave my food away to the wrong driver. We politely asked them to remake the food and he would wait but the employees refused. I went ahead and canceled my order through the app and called the store directly at approximately 2:10pm the manager on duty was EXTREMELY unprofessional and rude with me on the phone she never once apologized for the inconvenience and also told me she does not have to tell me her name. I was only asking for my order to be made again so I could pick it up myself. I will be escalating this issue with her higher ups and as far to corporate if I have to do so.  Every employee who got on the phone refusing to help and especially the manager on duty needs training on how to better handle a situation like this in the future. This is unacceptable behavior."

    "reviews": "Great spot. We found this place looking for a new sports bar & grill for lunch that had a chill vibe, pool table and good food. We found it. They only have one pool table, the biggest drawback. But the food was awesome, the service was on point, the environment was chill. We hit the happy hour time so got some good deals. 4 people with entrees, 1 appetizer, 3 tall beers & 2 shots was under $100. We will definitely be back. Great night to watch the Broncos game (except for the loss). The food was great as always. Shared wings, pizza rolls and canzone. Came with a larger group and everyone was happy. Crowd favorites were the pizza rolls and the Philly calzone. Check out the daily specials. Service was OK for being a busy night and for a large group. Steve is always great! Me and my friends came here after our annual ski trip and it was awesome. Everything from the drinks,service and food was great. Reasonable prices as well....especially drinks. A true classic American sports bar. Not many of these gems left! Much love from Nashville Tennessee. A nice cozy dive bar vibe. The pizza rolls were amazing and our waiter described it perfectly as little balls from heaven. They had a ton of tvs to watch the game and a nice selection of draft beers. Also had a pool table. This seemed like a super chill spot. A place where you can go and relax more watch a game that's playing have a couple drinks, eat some food, play a couple games of pool, and chit chat with some local people that seemed mostly friendly. I didn't get any unwanted vibes. They have a huge range of different types of food to choose from on the menu. Everything I tried was  great  except I wasn't  fond of the  spaghetti, it wasn't horrible but it wasn't the greatest. The cocktails we ordered were good and came out fast , The server was friendly and helpful,  And everything seemed to be at a decent price."

    "reviews": "Great food in a sports bar overlooking a golf course.\n\nBeen coming here often on for years after golf. The staff is always really friendly and the food is amazingly good. They\u2019re green chilies outstanding so don\u2019t be afraid to try their Mexican food.\n\nA great view of the putting green down below and the golf course Teebox is right there.\n\nThe waiting staff is always really friendly. Although the prices have gone up over the last few years, they\u2019re still very reasonable.\n\nHeavy pours in the bar make it a great place to go for a few drinks Pretty sweet little dive bar that\u2019s attached the the golf course. Definitely haven\u2019t been here in years and it was great to be back and experience the nostalgia. Recommend getting the tenders or just a basket of crispy tots. Great spot for a drink and chill after playing 18 holes. They got tvs and live sports so definitely good spot to watch anything that\u2019s one. The service was good, the ladies were very courteous and made sure we were well taken care of. I had an EXTREMELY generous order of corn dog bites. It made up three meals. I also had the chicken chimichanga. Also a very generous portion. They tasted very good. The service was quick. The men's room was clean and the restaurant itself was clean What an awesome place!  The views from the bar/grill are amazing.  Food quality and prices were amazing.  We had the De Beeper Burger and the chilie renyno.  Both were great tasting and well priced.  Service on a Wednesday afternoon around 4:30 was great!  Highly recommend. Consistently inconsistent.  I've been to Noonan's multiple times since they started Bingo. Cassy the Bingo caller is the only redeeming factor. Service is slow at best. It's recommended you bring your own silverware and condiments, as you are unlikely to receive any unless explicitly requested,  and by then your food will be cold. The kitchen lacks any consistency, the food often not cooked to order or correctly.  The atmosphere is lackluster and dated,  featuring stained and deteriorating ceiling tiles ready to fall in and small antique televisions that should be retired. I don't understand why the menu has prices on it because they have never once matched my bill, it seems like random numbers are pulled out of the air. I think condiments are extra because nothing matches the bill and it seems like I'm being nickel and dimed for everything.  The worst part is you never receive an itemized bill just a server announcing \"your total due is:\". SURPRISE your steak and bake special $14.95 was rung in at over full price $18\n95!\n\nTldr: poor service, poor food, unexpected pricing, and dilapidated dining room make this restaurant/bar an easy pass."

    "reviews": "This restaurant is inside the Hilton Double Tree Hotel. Good Happy Hour. Breakfast buffet was good & have a nice a la carte menu. We had such a lovely experience. Luis was the person whom helped us and delivered exceptional customer service. People like him make us feel welcomed and not miss home so much!\n\nForgot to mention- their cocktails are bomb! This place is amazing! Great hidden gem in Aurora! Atmosphere was awesome! Food was really delicious! Cocktails were fantastic! And the staff was on point about their customer service! We couldn't have asked for a better bartender! 10/10 Highly recommended! This is a good place. Good food overall. It's also inconsistent for the relatively higher price point. 3 stars because - A place that has such strong culinary gems, disappointed at the lack of presentation (e.g. of the impossible burger in pictures). Which service will you get next time you go? Could be excellent or mediocre - hence, 3 stars. Update:\n\nThe morning staff was a completely opposite experience. Extremely friendly and polite. You can tell they enjoy what they do. Kookie was amazing.\n\n(Original review)\nThe food was good. We ordered an appetizer that was super entertaining! Our problem was, as with the other restaurant we ate at the following day, the service. Not sure if it is a generational problem but both times we experienced the same thing. A young adult who treated us as if we were a bother to him for being there. \u201cYou\u2019re welcome\u201d must not be something they know how to say. Or eye contact. Or any communication at all. I\u2019m sure my age is showing but if we\u2019re gonna be tossing down $50+ on a meal some act of appreciation would get you so much further. Even if it is fake.\n\nWe\u2019re big on tipping as we\u2019ve both had history in the restaurant game. So when you treat us as if we\u2019re unwelcome we will tip as such."

    "reviews": "The food is pretty much standard quality. Applebee's used to be a great place to meet for late evening happy hour snacks and libations. We stopped here last week just for that reason.  Well, we had to wait 5 minutes to be seated in the bar area. Now just to be clear. The wait was not the fault of the greeter (Hanah) she is amazing.  She was seating guests, bussing tables, clean tables, and serving beverages. Meanwhile, the take out order folks were sitting at tables looking at there phones, glaring at staff and guests. Another person was leaning on the bar watching Hanah bust her butt. The bartender was busy as well, making drinks and taking food orders. While waiting on our food 3 groups of potential dinners left the restaurant. Simply tired of waiting to be seated. The folks that waited - truly waited. I know you are wondering,  where was the manager.  Well, she was in the back washing dishes \ud83d\ude44.  Hummm, I just don't know if I should go on. Perhaps Applebee's needs to train their managers to delegate duties.  Perhaps Applebee's should hire individuals with common sense and the ability to earn their pay? I just don't know what to say or how they are staying in business. Anyway, cheers to Hanah and the bartender. Ladies keep up the good work. How was my food you ask? Surprisingly fine. The small soup is about 3 bites. \"I have to give a massive shoutout to our incredible waiter! While we enjoyed our meal, we witnessed her dealing with an incredibly difficult couple behind us. They were fabricating a wild story about their steak, clearly trying to get a freebie. Despite their outrageous behavior and the fact they already received a discounted meal, they left a shockingly small $2 tip. Through it all, our waiter remained poised, professional, and unbelievably kind. She handled the situation with grace and patience, never letting it affect her service to us. She was attentive, friendly, and efficient, making our dining experience wonderful. Seeing her navigate such a stressful situation with such composure was truly impressive. She's a superstar! 5 stars all the way!\" Doesn't anyone ever do there job correctly except me??!!!  Absolutely a disgrace. The ribs taste like shoe leather. Looks like last night's left over. If they could receive a 0 I most certainly give it to them\n\nUPDATE: Mr Morris called me personally and was very professional. He apologized for the quality of food and was very kind. Thank you Mr Morris. This is how a problem should be handled. I appreciate it I haven\u2019t been to this particular Apple Bee\u2019s in a few years. Everyone was kind, especially our waitress, Monique. She was helpful and attentive.\n\nHer recommendation was the Blue Bahama Mama, and it was a great choice. I forgot to tell her how I\u2019d like my burger done, but she chose well. My kids meals were done well too - my youngest had his Mac n cheese before anyone else got their food. She realized we were ordering and recommended better options, which also included my drink.\n\nThe food was great, as well as the atmosphere. I highly recommend! Yesterday, May 24 (Saturday), I went to enjoy some All You Can Eat at Applebee\u2019s. I chose this location because it\u2019s usually less crowded, so we decided to give it a shot. Around 10:30 PM, there were only about 10 people in the restaurant\u2014not too busy.\n\nOur first round of riblets took about 25 minutes to arrive. I figured maybe it was just a one-time delay. After we finished, we ordered the second round at 11:10 PM\u2014and that one also took about 25\u201330 minutes. Our server mentioned the delay was due to fries not being ready\u2026 not sure how true that is, but I let it slide.\n\nIn total, it took almost two hours to get through just two rounds. I still left a tip because I believe everyone deserves something for their service, but honestly, I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll be coming back to this location."

Went in for karaoke on Sunday. It was a blast lots of singers and some were really really talented. Will go back in the future. It was my first time at Sheabeens. Can\u2019t wait to go back! Rebecca ( barmaid, waitress, cook, cleaner, pool table fixer) She did everything ! Not to mention she made the best wings I\u2019ve ever had in the state of Colorado. And all the while she was flying around being superwoman she was  professional, accommodating, and super friendly. Thank you Rebecca. You are amazing! Because of you, I will be back soon with a whole lot of my friends \ud83d\ude0a I really enjoy coming to Sheabeens on Sunday nights. Sundays are karaoke night and it's a blast every time I've gone. The bartender are experienced, people are friendly. And it always seems to be a good size crowd for being on a Sunday night. Fun atmosphere especially for St. Patrick's Day....bartenders seemed annoyed by being there in general, but it was a busy day so I can't judge them solely on that experience.\nI'd recommend it \ud83d\udc4d Its an ok neighborhood street bar. The bartender was grouchy and the band was mediocre. The sandwiches were very disappointing. Hardly any meat! The fried mushrooms tasted like grease and not fresh. Just a bunch of older regular customers that night. It was just ok."

Her counterpart had died in a motorcycle accident so she was all alone.\n\nBetween the great drink prices, the good service and the decent food I would definitely come back again.\n\nThey also have a few pool tables that are kept pretty busy at least on a Saturday night. Very rude day manager. Has her favorites. I tried jjs two seperate times. Ill never go back. To be honrst she favors her caucasian patrons. Ive heard this from a few peeps. The night bartender is cool and attentive. Kaci The food was good, loved the fries. The waitress/bartender was very nice and was trying very hard to make our experience five-star.\n\nThe cook was evidently new and messed up a few orders. We got it straightened out and they made it right. So...a little grace fire this review on this visit. Would go back and give it another shot. Food took a nose dive after the takeover, and somehow hasn't become any better since. Service is still very slow and poor, consistently prepared poorly or incorrectly, and the only positive part of the place was the limited pool tables. Pick any other bar out of hat in Aurora and you'll do better. Went with my wife and my sisters adult family.  The five of us ordered drinks, some non alcohol as well and everyone ordered food.  The waitresses we're all super friendly and took good care of us.  I expected the food to be bland but honestly it was really very good.  Little bit better menu than standard bar fair too.  Pics of food are here and everything was very satisfying."

    "reviews": "I stumbled upon this place for breakfast and it did not disappoint. The customer service was excellent, the establishment was clean and the food was delicious. I ordered the farmers skillet with sourdough toast and it was more than enough food. Their menu includes a little bit of everything ensuring everyone will find something that they enjoy. The LOW PRICES actually shocked me! We paid $14 for the chicken fried steak breakfast plate. Their menu is traditional diner food and the portions are surprisingly large. The service was absolutely impeccable, with friendly food servers, who stay on the floor and observe the dining room, making it really easy to get their attention for drink refills and to go boxes. It doesn't look like much on the exterior, it's in a strip mall with a busy grocery store. But inside was clean, pretty cute (no frills, no screens \ud83d\udc4d) and the tables were spaciously distanced from each other. I really enjoyed the family atmosphere and wide selection of their menu, and I definitely recommend a visit, if you're a fan of diner food, and we will be returning! Great diner menu with Mex items included. Breakfast Burrito is a great item to try. This place is very popular, but truth be told, their food is mediocre at best. We live in Aurora, and we love breakfast at 'mom and pop' restaurants. We travel all the way to Thornton for Pete's Cafe, or Westminster to Nancy's, or to 58th and Washington to the Red Rooster. Each one puts this place to shame. Really wish they were better so we didn't have to go so far for a really good breakfast and coffee! One of the best hidden gems in the area.  Large selection of food, all great quality and moderately priced coupled with friendly service.  All around a fantastic restaurant for any meal!"

    "reviews": "We've order take out here a couple of times recently.\nMy son loves the spaghetti with meatballs and I love the chicken alfredo. We ordered the pesto Alfredo without tomatoes but it has tomatoes.\nI'm always confused why neither the spaghetti or Alfredo comes with any kind of bread on to go orders.\nMy wife also didn't get her dipping sauce for her wrap.\nThe food is great but it's these little things that keep us from ordering here more often. We came in for pizza ahead of a movie at the nearby AMC. Neither of us had been to an Old Chicago in a long time, and weren\u2019t sure what to expect. He like a thin crust and I like a more traditional crust, so we started with some mozzarella sticks and each ordered an individual pizza.\nThe mozzarella sticks were good. Old school. Thin - but fresh and hot, which made all the difference. The pizzas were awesome. Being an East Coast transplant, I have the usual complaints about Colorado\u2019s version of traditional pizza crust. This was good crust - and not just \u201cgood for Colorado\u201d crust. The pizzas were both topped generously. The service was great. Will definitely be back. Our experience at this restaurant was positive overall. Our server was great, providing attentive service throughout our visit. While the bar side was busy, the dining room side was a bit slower. That being said, the food was good - I personally had a filling and delicious calzone with crispy texture and flavorful interior. My husband had a burger and sweet potato fries, which were decent. Additionally, they offer a good happy hour special, and I'm looking forward to returning to try another burger. All in all, I would recommend this restaurant. My family and I came in to get some food last night and we placed our order with a server at a little before 8pm. We live a couple minutes away and I resisted going there because of how bad the last few experiences we've had there (epic fails.) It took a few minutes to get drinks, but the issue was that we didn't get our order for over 35 minutes! Nobody came to let us know the kitchen was running behind, and when we got the order, our appetizers were delivered with our entrees! The server (with blue hair) proceeded to tell us another server would be replacing her for some reason that didn't make sense. We were fine with that. The person that replaced her was great, but the service wasn't great up to that point. Also, this is the second time I've order a personal pan pizza, (the Classic with pepperoni, mushrooms, and garlic). I don't understand if something isn't broken, then don't fix it??!! You used to bake the deep dish pan pizzas in a seasoned pan and the crust was crispy and incredible! It is why I have really enjoyed coming regularly (over 35 years). This is now the second or third time we went there and I have received a pizza served to me on a plate, not a serving pan, and you could tell the dough was undercooked in the center. The pizza dough doesn't even taste like dough. It tasted like bread that was thrown in a Hobart convection oven for breads and pastries. I know things change over time, but clearly the difference is very noticeable and really not great. Ya know I've had other deep dish pizzas I've ordered from other pizza shops. It was twice as much in price, took more time to make, and it was a THOUSAND times better than what you're serving, AND IT WAS TAKE OUT NO LESS, not a restaurant I sat down to eat at!! Sadly, I have no plans on going here anymore. The culture that I have noticed in your restaurant, the quality, and the service is mediocre at best. Old C's was my favorite growing up in Westminster and it just isn't even close to that quality anymore. Sorry and sad to see. Absolutely sweeping with the rating! Food was amazing and service was too, and the environment was outstanding!"

    "reviews": "I stopped by the Wendy\u2019s on Iliff and Buckley today, and ordered a Bacon Burrito and Frosty Coffee, and unfortunately, the experience was disappointing from the start. The burrito was poorly wrapped, the bacon and potatoes were overcooked, and the cheese tasted strange\u2014almost plastic-like. To top it off, the Frosty Coffee had a syrupy aftertaste that was unpleasant.\n\nWhile the food was not up to standard, I do want to note that the staff members were friendly and courteous. However, cleanliness was a concern, I noticed a stained wipe being used on my drink lid, which made me hesitant, I definately removed this before taking a sip.\n\nOverall, I\u2019d give this Wendy\u2019s a 2-star rating\u2014kind staff, but the food quality and cleanliness need serious improvement. Hopefully, they can address these issues to provide a better dining experience for customers in the future. One of the late might managers she had a blue shirt on. Was super super disrespectful. She got my order wrong twice!!! And still ended up giving me tue wrong stuff. The stupid ass ai machine you have in drive through took my order perfectly. It's your incompetent workers that need to learn how to do their job correctly. All I ordered was a Dave's double and two baconators burgers and a 10 piece nugget. First of all they charged me for 3 baconators and only gave me 2. Charged for a Dave's double and only gave me a single. This is ridiculous. I'm actually so disappointed. If I could leave 0 stars I would. Ordered a small chocolate frosty and was handed a vanilla caramel, I had no idea until I got home because its dark out. One of my fries was literally half empty. Tried calling the store 4 times and no one answered. It's truly upsetting that that's what I paid for. Manager handed me food looking completely away and didn't even look at or greet me. This is the 3rd time going to this location, something being wrong with my order, and it not being fixed at all. Last time there was issues with my child's meal. Disappointing and I will be calling back again to speak with the General Manager. We wanted to sit and eat, unfortunately not a clean table in sight, and they mess up the order every freaking time. Took 10 minutes to get a 'hello, one second',  and disappeared. My family of 5 ended up ordering at the screen. Don't know why since they got everything wrong anyway.\nThis was 730pm. On Thursday 3/27. Gross place.  Bathrooms are horrible.\nThis place needs a serious review or policy and staff. Very poor customer service. We made an order and waited 24 minutes to receive it. I asked the front what was taking so long, and the guy told me that they take drive through priority, responded that when I came in, the drive-through was empty, and he just walked away. I requested a refund, and the manager said that she had to escalate it to corporate. Waited for the food because she promised some free cookies and when I received my order I left. When I got home, there were no cookies in the bag."

I had a spicy chicken sandwich (don't recall the name) that was amazing. Lots of flavor and good doable portions. The price was good, like $15-17 for burgers and such. Worth the try! Bar staff and floor service staff attentive and hard working. Friendly, smiling and do their best even when busy!\nAngela, Gabby, Devin, Daemon, Amel, Lucy\u2026\nAll great! Special shout out to Natalie!!!\u2026.\nAlways smiling, always friendly and dedicated to providing patrons a great experience!!!! one of the most Popular Sports Bar in Lakewood. Friendly customers and staff. We ate customized Hamburgers(I tried to make ultimate Teriyaki Burger) were the Best.  We watched 2024 Stanley cup final Game 7 Edmonton Oilers v.s. Florida Panthers. THANK YOU.  2 customized burger, wing and boneless wing(2 different sauce and dip), 2 different beer, and happy hour coconut shrimp. It was St. Patrick's day and the place was packed. It was a seat yourself anywhere type of seating. I asked a gentleman if I could join him. It turned out that he was a regular there. I got some of his life story but he told me Friday nights get packed the same way. I had the obligatory corned beef and cabbage. They also had available bangers and mashers and Shepard's pie. I don't know if those are regularly on the menu but I'll be happy to go back and find out for you. There was a nice little patio that some people were hanging out on. Even on a coldish day. The food came fast and the Guinness was cold. I don't think that is usually on tap. At $9 per each one was plenty. Parking is a little odd but easy to figure out. Once you go up the street where the shoppette is, literally up the street there is a left turn into the lot.  The service was quick considering how busy it was. The atmosphere was typical at type but with windows. This place is definitely underrated.  For what seems to be a neighborhood dive bar type of atmosphere, we have always enjoyed our meals here.  Tall beers, good food, and sports on more than a dozen TV's...no complaints here!"

Ask about them for some great combos. Daniel's review was right. The IPA isn\u2019t really an IPA.\n\nSmall patio available for outdoor seating. Incredibly lovely employees here. It was my first time visiting and the customer service was absolutely fantastic. The staff will take proactive measures to make sure their customers are happy - my beer was slightly flat due to it being the last in the keg and the staff took the time to come up to where I was and replacing the drink free of charge and without me even asking. They care a lot about their brand and it shows. High quality beer with great variety. Owner/brewer was so friendly! Will most definitely be back. Thank you! Good beer, extremely friendly staff, and dog friendly which is nice. Plus have some gluten free and gluten-reduced for those with gluten sensitivity or celiac. Will be back! Very chill and laid back atmosphere with some traditional, gluten-reduced, and gluten-free beers. Dog friendly inside and out. There is also a park really close by. Worth a stop if you are in this part of Denver!"

    "reviews": "I struggle to give this place a 2-star review.  I am very confused about the high reviews.  The place needs more ventilation, it smells and is not very clean. We ordered a variety of food.. The food was not great, and it lacked flavor and taste.  Wings smelled and returned them. Tacos had no flavor.  The green chili was ok, but it was definitely not great. Had the nachos. they were decent but would not eat again.  Overall , it's a sports bar that has ok food.  Will not be going back! Service was good but not friendly. I really enjoyed it here.  I needed to kill a couple of hours while my son was at a meetup nearby and TJs was perfect.  If I lived nearby I'd be a regular.  The nachos were delicious!  Definitely too much for one person even as a half order but it is an appetizer which is typically for sharing.  I added beef and guacamole.  Yum!!! My neighbor at the bar had chicken wings and they smelled amazing.  I would recommend those based on smell alone.  The service was fast and friendly.  Lots of TVs with a variety of programming.  The bathroom was clean and well stocked.  I definitely recommend it. Great prices! Great service! Great atmosphere with a patio! Must go! And ask for Tony\u2026 he is super attentive and a great bartender! It was slow when we went in, but Tony made it feel comfortable and inviting! Definitely going back\u2026 did I mention the prices!? $3.50 all day till 6 pm for mixed drinks maybe $4.00 at the most! Unheard of! Love a restaurant/bar keeping it real! (And in my budget) Thank you guys! This place is remodeled and awesome! Lots of seats and a great patio. Huge bar, food portions and good at that! Our server, Sarah S was amazing! We got the grilled cheese, grilled ham and cheese. One with pub chips and the other with fries. It was delicious and at a great price! Definitely worth it and will be back! Decent food. Lots of TVs for sport and the crowd REALLY gets into the games, like standing for the anthem and removing their hats and placing their hand.. and when a Denver/Colorado team scores, the place is pretty electric. It is a little bright if you're used to dark/dingy bars. The staff are friendly too. Really nice people."

    "reviews": "This is a super cool place with a chill vibe and great theme. Bowling and Pool is cheap to play here. Drinks were good. Didn\u2019t try the food but the wood fired pizzas looked pretty good This is my honest assessment based on 40-50 visits since opening as well as other friends' opinions over the years. I visit 1-2 times/month tops.\n\n+ friendly bar staff\n+ roomy & clean environment\n+ regular bar hours\n+ higher than average quantity of beer taps\n+ mid to mid-high beer pricing w/ some daily specials\n+ decent liquor selection/quantity\n+ ok happy hour pricing for beer/wells\n+ decent sized bar, ok additional seating options\n+ reasonable bowling prices (4 lanes)\n+ reasonable full-sized pool prices (free happy hour)\n+ unique airplane motif\n- mediocre food (pizza best option, ok wings, burgers not recommended)\n- slow kitchen\n- high prices on liquor/rocks pours\n- higher than normal revolving staff (very few long term employees)\n\nI've enjoyed most of my visits here, have had fun with the staff, it's good for larger parties or late night drinking/dining. It is pricier than many other Lakewood options for what it actually is but the size, pool tables/bowling, and no parking issues make this bar an easy one to visit. As it stands this is a good option for a social place to visit with friends and have some fun & drinks. If food is your main priority I would consider other options first. We love this bar in our neighborhood. The prices are great and it's not usually packed. Great place to hang out with friends if you want to talk and not have super loud music. They have pool and bowling plus outdoor seating. It was not at all what I expected.\nThe food has great presentation  but not good flavor. It was our first  time at the location  and I asked the employee to inform me how things worked. It wasn't  explained and I felt rush to make an order. The employee  seemed  to have no patience to guide us through  the location's process. It was the bowling  that brought  ust to the location. Now that was fun. Had the supreme pizza, incredible..I had low expectations for a bowling alley bar. But my goodness. Incredible. I became a glutton... Couldn't stop there. Ended up getting some buffalo wings and as well as a BLT. Luis and Riss really set this place over the top. Despite all the action ( due to the sports games) she managed to navigate the crowd and offer timely, friendly, accurate service. So refreshing... This is my new favorite spot. 12/10.\n\nI am so in love with this place now. I came to play bowling. But ended up only playing pool. And some chess... I am so so dummy awkward but here. I felt like a regular."

    "reviews": "Star Thai never misses. The stuff that is supposed to be crispy stays perfectly crispy. The stuff that is supposed to be creamy stays perfectly creamy. The spice level is usually consistent from order to order and is balanced throughout the whole curry dish (usually order hot/4).\n\nWhether it\u2019s authentic is a debate someone more knowledgeable about Thai food than me should have. All I know is I\u2019ve ordered a lot of Thai takeout throughout the years in different U.S. and Canadian cities with bustling Asian food scenes. Consistency can be hard to come by\u2026 Star Thai knows how to make sweet, savory, and umami in all the right spots AND always with great service. Total hidden gem. Great Thai takeout. Best we've had in the area and the owners and staff are lovely and so kind.  Before anyone complains, they have a message on their phone that they will be on a family trip from May 27th until July 10th 2025. Love that they are taking the time to do that. Can't wait to have some great food when they come back. Great place for take-out. Their green curry and cheese wantons are amazing. I prefer a more savory, soupy curry and that's what they serve here. Packed with flavor, fresh veggies, and good portions for a more reasonable price than you'll find at most Thai places in Denver. AMAZING!!\n\nWas very impressed by Star Thai and will definitely be back again!\n\nQuality - delicious! Was very impressed by the flavors. Especially loved the red curry chicken (ordered medium)! Great flavor profile, lots of meat & veggies. Drunken noodles had a bit of a smoky (almost burned?) flavor I hadn\u2019t experienced before, but was good nonetheless.\n\nPortion sizes - a bit smaller than your average Thai restaurant, but so are the prices! I\u2019d say sizes are fair for the price.\n\nSpice levels - proceed with caution! Saw mixed reviews on the spice levels. I have a decent spice tolerance and the hot drunken noodles was at the upper end of my enjoyable spice limit. What an absolute gem! This place is a hidden secret and I absolutely loved it. Went with my wife and a couple friends and we had great service, amazing food, and the dining area is really cozy. I recommend getting the Thai coffee, very sweet and rich. Will definitely be coming back."

The Only thing that was good was the coleslaw and custard!! After Waiting in my car for 30 minutes this is what I received! Also No plastic ware to eat with! The only reason I got my custard is because I ask about it when they finally came with my order!! Never eating here again except the custard!! \ud83d\ude21 I don't know if its customary, but they could use a little pep in their step. The staff was phenomenal. We had Ophelia and Mando help us out. They were patient as my kids picked out every last bit of customization towards their ice cream and burgers. The food was tasty and I had no issues beyond it taking 45 minutes on a to go order. We went back the next day to get the daily flavor shake the second day, and they still took a bit. If you are in a hurry, I would pass. If you have the time to wait, it is worth it. Asked for no cheese and no onion, my husband also asked no onion and both sandwiches got both. There was no sauce on it at all. We waited 10 extra minutes for the food and were told to park. We listed everything we wanted specifically and it still came out horrible! This is our 3rd trip and everytime something has gone wrong. I won\u2019t be recommending this place or even going back. There\u2019s no reason everytime we go that there\u2019s something wrong with the order or something missing. 3 TIMES. I went through the drive through and Maddox helped me. I am thoroughly impressed by his customer service! You don't get that much nowadays. He is such an uplifting young man! The food is great, but sometimes the wait can be long, but it is cooked to order so it\u2019s worth the wait! Custard should always be ordered."

Call in for the Fast and Fresh 12\" deals at 7.99 you can't get it online.  It is take out only Waited over an hour for our take out food, and it was pretty meh. BBQ pizza had like no BBQ sauce, and we asked for thick crust, and it was super thin. They did apologize for the wait so we still tipped, but a single pizza, an individual salad, bread sticks and frozen cheesecake slices cost almost a hundred dollars. I had a really good experience with the staff, who was just one man working the shop. Unexpectedly kind and the cheesy bread we got is great. HUGE for very little money at this location. The marinara of this chain is unmatched for anything around the price point , like it\u2019s slightly sweet slightly spiced and actually reminds you of tomatoes. Thanks! This was our first time, because the hours were 3 pm to 3 am. No complaints, just kept forgetting. This pizza was so crisp and fresh! Best we've had in town... now we can't wait to return for the other pizzas and cannolis I noticed they offer! Sorry, we ate a couple of pieces before I took a photo. Ordered pickup on Christmas Day and these lovely people were open. My roommate and I were just chillin on Christmas and ordered from here. Didn\u2019t grab the lady\u2019s name who helped us but she was very sweet and ensured we had everything we needed. And the pizza is amazing!!! Great quality bread for crust and the cheese to sauce ratio is 10/10. Thanks! Will be back."

When I got home, there was bacon in it. I don't eat bacon. Even when it's just sitting there, I don't eat food that comes into contact with bacon. So I never got to try the burger, it went in the trash. I wish I would have saved the money and 10 minute walk instead of getting the completely wrong food. Elliot was the one who served me. Also, why did I get a straw? I never ordered a drink. Regular fries instead of baconator fries and no saucy nuggs, awesome This restaurant is consistent. Burgers are old condiments are too cold. Bun was stale. French fries were cold. And then you have to put up with a attitude. I go so long between visits to this restaurant. I forget how bad it is. It's pretty nuts that, when the process of ordering food has been streamlined for the customer, the order can still be made incorrectly. Beyond that, old and stale ingredients. This is far less a slam against the employees as I know they make shit money so I can't quite blame them. Guess what, I also make shit money, and yea you get what you pay for, but not in this instance. When I pay for something, I should not be missing items or ingredients. Corporate, get your shit together, pay your fking employees better and maybe your standing will improve. It's a Wendy's. I like their food better than other fast food places. I feel like the beef is better quality and you can customize a little better using the app  (BTW, use the app!). I don't eat a lot of fast food, but when you're in a pinch, you can feel a tad bit better about Wendy's. I like the fresh squeezed lemonade. if you have tea on hand (I always do) it's a great mixer and isn't HFCS."

I waited 3 minutes, and a crew member looked up while she was prepping food, stuffing bags, and handing me stuff while the boy looked at his phone. I told them they forgot the item, and the boy stated they ran out. Would I like another item? I said, \"Do you do particle refunds? Not a wait a minute , or hold on , just shut the windows got the manager and the manager came upfront to refund. It seemed like a pain by the look on the managers face and said, \"No worries, I'll do another item, which is what I tried to say before he shut the windows to call for the manager. Point to story: Be more patient, meaning allow the customer to respond  completely before  cutting communication off and continuing to look at an electronic device. He would of saved 7 minutes of both our lives by using 10 seconds to communicate properly.  Besides that love this Wendy's!! Food is decent. Wrong sometimes. Workers all look like they don't want to be there. No fake smiles or anything. My question now is... Why is the handicap parking spot all the way in the back next to the dumpster??? ADA is pretty bad here. They love serving raw sandwiches that you pay a lot of money for. The employees also weren\u2019t very nice. I sincerely hope I don\u2019t get sick from this. Love the strawberry limonada. They haven't gotten my order wrong. Pregnant wife ordered a chicken sandwich came home to a raw chicken sandwich"

    "reviews": "Love this place. It\u2019s definitely a heavy metal Headbanger atmosphere. It\u2019s too bad It\u2019s not bigger. It looks like it would be a great place to have a stage and live music. But starting out with a five star review, the food was exceptional. We got the Pork green chili tater tots to start followed by the homemade battered buffalo chicken sandwich. It was exceptionally good and lightly drizzled with buffalo sauce. I probably would\u2019ve asked for a little extra sauce, but was content. The french fries were not shoestring but skinny fries, piping hot with salt and pepper which I really liked. We also got the gluten-free brisket mac & cheese with green chili, which was exceptional. The brisket was better than what we\u2019ve had at some barbecue joints and would highly recommend it. This was such an awesome spot. We were so hungry after a long day of snowboarding.  Perfect spot for the best  food in town. A few of us had the brisket sandwich, which was so yummy. The meat was perfectly done, and the flavor was amazing.  The sweet potato fries were so delicious. They  also had one of the best Moscow mules. Our server was really good, very attentive, and offered good suggestions.  Thank you, Denise! We will be coming back to this spot for sure. Really enjoyed all the food. The Brutal Poodle was the most unexpected celiac friendly restaurant that I have ever been to. My 7 year old daughter has celiac disease and after our 2 night stay at a Denver Hampton watching her older sister taking full advantage of the waffle bar, it was our mission to find a gluten free waffle before leaving the city. After a few phone calls, we found ourselves being walked to our table by the tattooed host of a death metal themed pub with music my kids have never heard before. I wasn\u2019t exactly sure what to expect. Then came our waiter. He kneeled down next to my youngest daughter, looked her right in the eyes and told her, not us, everything they could do gluten free for her. It was impressive!!! Dedicated fryers, dedicated grill, gluten free buns for the burgers, gluten free noodles for the Mac and cheese! They had waffles and chicken tenders! I don\u2019t think there was a single item on the menu that they couldn\u2019t do for her! And to top it all off, it was a great experience and a teachable moment for my family to learn that just because something seems hard or rough on the outside, it doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not kind and thoughtful or caring on the inside. The Brutal Poodle did right by my daughter and our family and I highly recommend it!!! 10/10. If you like metal music and yummy food, this place is for you. I enjoyed the moody ambiance, tastefully hung art and cool band posters. It was clean, the employees were attentive and had an eclectic mix of patrons. The skull bead on my sandwich toothpick was a nice touch. Happy hour every day from 11-6! Plus, they serve Malort. \ud83d\udc80\ud83e\udd18\ud83c\udffd Brutally good food.\n\nVisiting The Brutal Poodle was actually on our list of things to do the first time we were in Denver but never made it. So, Cassey and I made plans to visit before she dropped me off at the airport. We arrived a few hours before my flight took off and were greeted by a friendly bartender and heavy metal playing.\n\nThe Brutal Poodle is a restaurant/bar that is heavy metal themed. I was so excited to eat and drink here because I love me some heavy metal and it does not disappoint on that at all.\n\nCassey and I ordered a beer and the Brutal Burger. Cassey got hers with a side salad and I got mine cooked to medium rare. It took about 15 minutes for our food to come out and I ordered a second beer shortly after the food was brought out.\n\nOne or two bites into the burger and I knew this was the best burger I\u2019ve ever had. Each bite was better than the last and it was 100% juicy and full of flavor. The fries were also delicious and seasoned to perfection. After two big beers and the fat burger and large amount of fries, I was stuffed. Cassey really enjoyed her food, too. The skewers they used to hold the burgers together had little skulls on them. Very on-point for this place.\n\nNow that I am back home, I keep telling everyone about The Brutal Poodle and tell them to check it out if they are ever in Denver. In fact, I am about to order a shirt off their website to wear around town. See if you can spot it in some of the photos in my future posts.\n\nStay brutal, crank the heavy metal, and throw some horns in the air."

We stopped here before the DU game and grabbed some food and beers. It was on our pub pass which we always like and the nachos were delicious. I\u2019m a big ipa drinker and they had two on the board I like the hazy.  Reasonably priced and a fun atmosphere. Lunch was so good.  Our  bartender Maddie was awesome, a little sassy but just our style. She was super helpful with picking just the right beer for my husband, when he was in a mood of not being easy to please. \ud83e\udd23 And her shoes (see pic) were perfect!!  Buffalo wings were great and the blue cheese that went with them was amazing.  The chicken nachos were the best I\u2019ve had, they had a little bit of all the toppings in every bite!  We will definitely be back next time we are in Denver! Fantastic and fun neighborhood brewery. Food is delicious and they have a good variety. We found the brewery via our Pub Pass  and so glad we came. Brewery on site is fun to watch in action."

I\u2019d probably stick with their non brunch items. I was OBSESSED with the Brussels sprouts. Will definitely be back! Best patty melt and cheese curds ever!\n\nUpdate : So... I just had the fish tacos and the Brussels sprouts on the happy hour menu... Holy smokes. That was amazing! Best bottomless mimosas in Denver and the monster cinnamon roll is to die for! Found a little hidden gem of Denver and highly recommend :) Stumbled on this place trying to find somewhere open on Christmas Eve before heading to the Broncos game. Wow we were blown away! Vibe is local sports bar- food is AMAZING! We ordered the pretzels with queso cheese and fried pickles as an app. I\u2019ve been on a hunt to find a great pretzel appetizer & found it here! Fried pickles are always a fave of mine and these were crisp & came with great dipping sauce. Next I had the Jam burger\u2026. Wow\u2026. Just wow! I did substitute the brie for goat cheese- it was perfection. The burger was so juicy and flavorful. The bacon jam paired perfectly. Highly recommend this burger.\n\nService was also amazing. Everything was prompt and hot. I wish I would have got our servers name- but she was a rockstar. Definitely will be back Everything was incredible from start to finish! Service was fast for only having one guy run the show and food came out quick. The burgers were delicious with buns being super soft and not overwhelming the rest of the burger (we got \u2018The Jam\u2019 and Spanks). Their coleslaw was the first one I haven\u2019t had to add salt & pepper and was flavorful on its own! Definitely will be back."

    "reviews": "Crimson and Gold is a hidden gem near DU\u2014the atmosphere is always lively, welcoming, and a perfect way to get the night started. The vibe strikes the perfect balance between laid-back and energetic. Aside from the atmosphere, let\u2019s talk about the real MVP: the blonde bartender who gave absolutely stellar service. Charming, quick with a pour, and somehow managed to handle the packed bar gracefully. 10/10 will be back, mostly because I think my drink misses me. The absolute worst service I\u2019ve received at any trashy college bar in my life. Two years of visits in a row I\u2019ve experienced bartenders who will blatantly serve people who just walked up in front of you, and continue to ignore you. Crazy attitude to go with it. Watched the bartender pour everyone\u2019s drink with half the amount in a normal single as well. Just drink anywhere else first if you plan on going here. Went here before the DU hockey game.  Server with the 8ball jacket on was awful.  Took 15 minutes to be greeted, another 15 minutes to get a soda and a beer.  She said there was a communication error.  Watched her sitting by the bar eating chicken wings not concerned about doing her job at all.  We won\u2019t be returning.  Awful service. C&G is classic. I absolutely love this bar and they have earned my patronage for years to come. This is a staple in town and I would highly recommend a visit. Crimson and Gold have their vibe. It's a fun place on the weekends but would recommend that you be a student to enjoy the atmosphere.\n\nTheir pioneer ale was pretty good tho. Their Cornhole setup was awesome!"

    "reviews": "Swung through the drive thru today to grab a quick lunch.  The employee working the drive thru could not have been nicer. Yes, it's pricey for fast food, but the sandwiches are fresh made and the chicken is always fabulous. I was very disappointed in the quality of my food and service, especially since this business has been hyped up to me by locals and other people that live in the area. I came by later at night looking for a little snack and I definitely got that. I just think the quality of the food and the taste of the food we\u2019re very subpar, it was very greasy and just nasty. My fries definitely were not fresh. The only good thing that came out of my visit was the Dr Pepper, which is hard to mess up. I\u2019m a big chicken lover. I like Hattie B\u2019s in Nashville. I like Chick-fil-A. I like Dave\u2019s hot chicken I even like a chicken place in Salt Lake City, but this place was overpriced and disgusting.Will definitely not be going back. This is easily some of the worst food I\u2019ve had. The chicken was small, dry, and hard. The coleslaw had minimal dressing and tasted off. The tots tasted like they were cooked in old grease and were soggy. I had to crisp them up in the air fryer. The dipping sauce was good, but that\u2019s it. Overall, this was a very disappointing experience. I will not return. I hate birdcall. To begin, the only reason I came here was because my brothers at chick fil a needed a day of rest. the food was terrible. I tried to place my order at one of the dumb iPads but it kept glitching out and messing with my order. It forced me to get the \u201cmeal combo\u201d which was just an elaborate ploy to make me spend more money. Before I finished my order the iPad glitched out and crashed so I had to start my order all over again. Not only this, after the incompetent worker pronounced my name wrong, I eagerly opened my box to the wrong chicken sandwich. The \u201ctractor\u201d drinks were terrible and the chicken was dry. Also, what kind of name is \u201cBirdcall\u201d? Terrible service led to a horrendous experience. Absolutely ruins 2025. Thanks a lot Birdcall Birdcall here was pretty good! They had a good amount of seating, friendly and fast staff, clean, and location was great! The chicken tenders were tasty and the fries were great. They did get my shake wrong though it was the same price and was delicious, they also were weak on the fry portion which was why I gave away a star. Overall, a good Birdcall location in the DU area! Would recommend."

    "reviews": "Did not eat but had three tall beers for $50 bucks. I\u2019m all for a tall beer but stadium prices is not cool. Beer does not cost that much from vendors. It\u2019s definitely beat up inside, showing age. Lots of machines were down and or not working appropriately. The bartender was super nice, TVs at the bar were like 480i. Christ. You would be better watching sports on your Apple Watch. Over all kind of sad inside ha. That\u2019s really how it felt. The music and atmosphere was good not great, the bathrooms needed more attention. Several games were out of order. The serving staff was great but the host could have done better. The host sat me, my partner and my baby in small table next to the wall which I didn\u2019t mind at first, until maybe 30 minutes in we had just placed our food order and while we\u2019re waiting my partner takes the baby to check out the games and the same host that sat us there comes to my table and asks me \u201care you still using the high chair?, or  can i take it away cause it\u2019s blocking the way for the servers to get through.\u201d The food and our drinks haven't even been served yet, and just because my baby is not sitting at the table with me he wants to take his chair away, he should not have sat us there in the first place if the chair was going to be in the way of the servers. I tell him \u201c my baby still needs the chair, so he pushes the chair back in and walks away.\u201d That there ruined my mood, I just wanted to have a good time with my family, and than when the food comes, the only thing worth eating were The Loaded Barbacoa fries and the fried pickles. My baby is not a picky eater but he said the chicken tasted funny so I tried it and it did, so he didn\u2019t finish eating it he just ate the fries, my partner ordered the Mac and cheese, fried pickles and The triple bacon burger, he ate the hamburger cause there\u2019s no point in letting the food go to waste but it wasn\u2019t the best burger he\u2019s ever tried, it was missing a very important ingredient LOVE!. And the Mac and cheese definitely tastes better when it\u2019s hot, otherwise when it cools down it turns out to be very runny and disappointing. If you get The Loaded Barbacoa fries try getting a little bit of everything and get a fried pickle if you like them of course and it will be the perfect bite! Disclaimer: I'm not an individual who posts only negative reviews. In fact, I often try to hype up places that are worthy of being advertised via word of mouth or here on this platform.\n\nBLUF: If any health organization were to visit here, i have no doubts they'd be heavily fined, if not shut down within a matter of weeks.\n\nThat being said, my idea of a late Christmas present/surprise trip here (I figured 1/2 price game night was easier on the budget for me too) was the absolute worst experience I've ever had at a Dave and Buster's....starting with the most obvious glaring lack of respect or cleanliness of their restrooms. Upon entry i had entered the arcade restrooms only to find out that half of the toilets were inoperable/doors taped shut with blue tape. The one I tried using was similar to using a bidet overseas with water jets involuntarily flushing underneath me as I proceeded to try using the bathroom....absolutely unnecessary and disgusting. There was 1 toilet in particular that was overflowing with soiled toilet tissue all over it. Tissue scattered about all over the floor was the least of my worries since I understand it's difficult to police people 100% of the time. Working toilets on the other hand and warm running water to wash hands afterwards are MINIMAL essentials every place needs.\n\nUpon bringing this to the attention of the manager, she used the fact that most of her staff being women as the reason why they were caught unaware by my concerns. She then called a young associate (didn't look older than about 18) over to \"take care of cleaning the restrooms\" as if he were some sort of miracle worker, janitor, or plumber capable of repairing toilets...unfair to this lone person in my opinion when this looked like a job for a whole crew of professional deep cleaners & handypeople to restore things back to working order\n\nFast forward to when we actually tried enjoying the arcade despite nearly leaving right away after these revelations, not only did the place stink like the smell of old dirty carpets, only about half the games were operable, that is the games that weren't already covered in left behind trash from customers...absolutely disgusting once again\n\nSuch a shame for this place, being one of few entertainment venues in denver to be this poorly mismanaged. I definitely and unfortunately won't be going back to this location and I'll be forewarning anyone with common sense to steer clear of here until they can get someone capable of overhauling things here.\n\nFor this being a Wednesday evening and this place to be a ghosttown like feel truly illustrated their lack of patronage for their customers. I get it if things are super busy and employees just didn't have time to get to cleaning their facilities but to see this deplorable condition made me rethink my decision to invest in them at all going forward. In such a place where people pay hundreds just to be entertained, they have some kind of nerve providing substandard amenities. I love their chicken wings it\u2019s one of the best I\u2019ve ever tasted. I got the unlimited? Option for wings during happy hour and got myself some drinks. Drinks and wings were good. However game wise it was pretty quiet . It used to be very crowded.. maybe it\u2019s the day and time I choose to go is different . But I did win a prize. Fun games however some of the machines were out of order but cashier gave credit to make it up . Overall it was nice Mia was absolutely sensational! She truly made our dining and gaming experience. Time was limited with our barrel of monkeys but as the manager Mitch saw she was quick, efficient, bubbly, and just flat out had a great attitude. I hope to be in her section next time we bring the family. Thanks Mia! (Oh and the latest menu is top notch so good work there)"

We ordered a drink that was not on the menu and she make it possible and it was perfect \ud83c\udf79 A friend of mine loves this place and told me that we should go while visiting Denver. I got the Ya Mar pizza and was blown away by how good it was. I'm not sure when I last had a pizza that compared, but it must have been at least a decade ago.\n\nThe atmosphere and service were also top-notch for a cozy late afternoon/early evening chat.\n\nI love unique local restaurants, and I highly recommend this spot for anyone visiting the area. I love this place. Great service, great food, and reasonable prices. It can be a little loud, but the outdoor seating is usually a little quieter. We always enjoy a meal at Esters!  Food is great, service is great and we can pick to either be tucked away in a room with lots of tv\u2019s to watch sports or grab a more \u201copen air\u201d table on the enclosed patio.

    "reviews": "Smothered burrito was piping hot. Honestly, the green chili here is really good. Also got a shrimp cocktail, it was on the sweeter side. Still really good, and they offer a small and a large option. Really dope. Overall was very fast and good food. Nothing phenomenal though. Good portion size. The service was great! The food was ok. It\u2019s tough to stand out in Denver serving Mexican food. Given that, it\u2019s on par, as expected and did not exceed any expectations. I would recommend this place to come for a pitcher of margaritas with chips and salsa on the side. Worth it for the drinks! The service and the margarita were great! The food not so much\u2026 I did enjoy the chips salsa, even though the salsa is a different flavor profile than I\u2019m used to.\n\nI ordered a combo plate to try a variety of their food, and unfortunately it was really mediocre. The ground beef taco had a great texture but the beef lacked flavor. I really did not like the sauce for the cheese enchilada, not a good combo. And the chili relleno had great flavor, but the breading was SO tough. Something had to be wrong - the breading had the texture/toughness of beef jerky; it was really difficult to cut or chew through. The beans and rice were good. La Fogata has been our family favorite since we moved into the neighborhood ten years ago. Aside from the delicious and consistent food and drinks, the staff is among the kindest you'll find and the restaurant space is welcoming. We've tried most everything on the menu and it's all terrific - love the fresh salsa so much! We've celebrated a lot of special occasions (and it's a great Friday night after a long week destination), and I know we will for years to come. I love the depth of their menu, and there are many choices for people with a variety of dietary restrictions. Such a gem, it's places like these that really help a neighborhood feel like home (and are delicious too \ud83d\ude0a)."

    "reviews": "This is a Vietnamese restaurant in a strip mall. The menu isn't huge, but it contains several interesting selections. The Thit Xa Xiu bahn mi was excellent. They give you the option of with or without jalape\u00f1o in addition to choice of protein. The sandwich was slightly sweet from the pork and fresh vegetables. The crusty roll it was served in was fresh.\n\nService was fast, polite and attentive. The space is modern. It's not overly decorated and pleasant. Tables are spaced so as to not feel crowded.\n\nThere is plenty of parking available. I got to eat one meal during my medical testing and it was this one. I ordered on door dash and received basically nothing but bread for 26$. When I called to ask for a PARTIAL refund. They refused and said \"sorry Denver is expensive\" I've paid the same for bao buns many places that are incredible for less, more and the same price.  Unfortunately, this restaurant only cares about profit!  The Bahn mi\u2019s are good here and the service is always fast. I got a noodle bowl and I think it was the biggest one I\u2019ve had! The beef was tender and I really like the egg rolls. I would prefer a bit more grilling on the shrimp. You also get coconut water served in a coconut which was fun. Had an appointment around the corner and needed comfort food after and this place was perfect for turning our day around. Different sizes of pho bowls, multiple options for meat, 3 options for broth, and the boba was so delicious! Great customer service, patient and kind! There\u2019s a menu item that looks like it\u2019s a lot of food \u201cserved in a special way\u201d and we will be back to try that! Came here based on other reviews. First off, the food. It's good. I got the pho, and the broth was flavorful. The amount of noodles, veggies, and proteins was more than plenty.\n\nThe atmosphere is a typical pho restaurant. It's clean with a simple and easy menu. You pay at the register, so don't expect any checks once you're done.\n\nThe service was great, too. Orders taken quickly, and food arrived in good timing. Really nothing that makes this place deserve less than 5 stars."

There wasn't so much lettuce that it masked everything else. The shoestring fries that came with it were also very good.\n\nService was very good. It was prompt and friendly.

They do have password protected Wi-Fi available for guests.\n\nAmple parking is available. So, it was Thankgiving Day.  I had volunteered for 12 hours to help prepare and serve 18,000 meals.  I did not want Thanksgiving food!  I wanted wings.  Skippy's amazingly was open filled with people not interested in the Thanksgiving celebration, watching sports, playing pool, having a beer, drinks, and eating.  I had wings and fries fried perfectly.  I was also introduced to a beer similar to Newcastle.  My waitress was extra nice.  There are over 30 flat-screens broadcasting every sport imaginable.  ... A very chill and neighborhood feel.  ... a mature crowd.  I had burgers here before too.  ...dope! Experience warm hospitality and savory food at the bar. Find the hidden gem on this side of town. Will definitely be back with more people. Food is delicious. Drinks are more than reasonably priced. And the staff is incredible. Many bars are near my house, but this bar is beyond worth the drive. Have been coming here for a while and it\u2019s consistent every time! Food is always hot and fresh, and drinks always come out in a timely manner.

However the beer was excellent. The atmosphere is very chill, they have games people are just playing, feels like a very local brewery frequented by local people.\nI'm definitely coming back here, the staff was very nice, bathrooms very clean, very chilled vibe as I said. I kinda wish I lived closer. what a great neighborhood gathering spot! Very spacious, lots of seating\n\nObviously a great selection of beers! My favorite: the stouts! As I said during my visit \"10% ABV? Fuck yeah!\" Friendly staff (who appreciated my comment - ha!). They also offer pizza which I can't wait to try because I'm a huge fan of thin crust pizza and the pic looks like it's wafer thin - yay (stay tuned for an updated review)\n\nTons of parking! I stopped by tonight for a beer with a friend of mine, and we had a really good experience! The girl behind the bar was wonderful. I don\u2019t typically care for beer, but we talked for a minute and she recommended a grapefruit super power, and it was great! I\u2019ll absolutely be back and recommend this brewery to anyone. Easily one of the best, if not the best, breweries around. The staff is incredible, as is the beer. Andrea is always a blast and offers great insights into new beers. Have been coming here regularly for many years and hope for many more to come. Don't sleep on this hidden gem. Always a good vibe. One of the best, most relaxed environments I have experienced in a brewery and a long time. Come here to chill out and drink some great beer."

They also make the best green salads, original Greek recipes, and salad dressings incredibly delicious.\nAdditionally, the food is healthy and fit \ud83e\udd70 Amazing pizza worth a 45-minute drive. It's SO delicious. The crust is thick but soft and edible. The meats are fresh, and cooked perfectly. Same with the vegetables.\n\nI have to drive in rush hour traffic to pick up and have not regretted it. I would rather spend my money on such pizza than crappy Pizza Huts or chain \"pizzeria's\" that are closer.\n\nLooking forward to picking up again soon. Came from Colorado springs to try denvers best pizza and it did not disappoint.  The pepperoni pizza was nice and thin.  The sauce on the pizza was very tasty and brought the whole package together.  Toppings were well placed.  Pizza is reasonably priced and much better than those chain restaurants. Definitely worth the visit.  Military discount is available.  I will be coming back for more I don't know if they feel rushed because drivers show up and wait, but I ordered 2 pies and both were so undercooked that I had to put it in my own oven for 10 minutes before it was edible. Raw dough. The pictures show char on the crust and I was excited for something like that, and only disappointed when they got here. The pizza was just ok after my own cooking but a huge improvement to my first bite into raw dough I visited my friend in Denver from Chicago and I heard about this place from an episode of Kitchen Nightmares. The food was excellent. I ordered some meatballs and a pizza. The owner, Pete, is hilarious!"

I ordered a Pepsi, but it was just a cup full of ice and color, with absolutely no taste.\nI couldn\u2019t even eat the food\u2014I literally threw it away!\nThis was my first and definitely last time visiting this place. Honestly, I\u2019ve never hated a restaurant this much. I do not recommend it at all. Stopped here for lunch on a Monday. The baked potato with sour cream and chives was good. However, the chili was somewhat spicier than usual and more watery as well. Several of the drink options in the machine were unavailable.\n\nService was a little slow, but okay. The space was clean but had a number of pylons notifying of wet floors. They had apparently been left out for some time since the floors were all dry when I was there. They do have Wi-Fi for customers.\n\nNone of the parking spots were in use when I arrived. This was a super fun experience! We each wanted 50 nuggets (300) in total! They made them fast, hot, fresh! This might be the best Wendy's I have been to! Seriously, the entire experience was amazing! I will definitely be coming back to this location! The staff was super accommodating and patient with us! This location doesn't have the 50 nug speical, which is normally 15$! So this is actually 20$! Clean, prompt and gets the orders right. Plus the lettuce and tomato is so crisp you might want to try ordering salads here. Keep up the great work and being one of the few fast food chains that actually tastes great these days. I\u2019m just a bit frustrated because this was my main Wendy\u2019s closet to my house and have had many great experiences previously. Usually one of the most reliable restaurants near by. But this month I have tried to go three different times and there is always some reason why they can\u2019t help me. The last two times they said they were doing cash only, and today they said the system was down completely. Maybe it has just been bad timing on my part but after a long day of work and my commute I\u2019m looking for something reliable and easy for dinner. This location is definitely not it and will not be going back."

Amazing food, seriously the best falafel I\u2019ve ever had and no contest best Mediterranean food as well. Didn\u2019t feel Americanized, felt and tasted authentic. For two people - baba ganoush and order of falafel & a chicken shawarma to share. Mint lemonade is a MUST, but you know that already, you\u2019ve never had one like it.\nPerfect amount of food, amazing quality. Place was empty so felt a bit cold atmosphere - not the cleanest, but definitely the tastiest! Just GO! This is made to order food! That means it\u2019s not cooked at microwave speed and is an experience to say the least. Be patient because what comes out is worth it! We enjoyed many different things, all equally good. The hot tea and mint lemonade is what we still think about! Sadly the tea was all I got a picture of but take my word for it- the food was spectacular! So many flavors danced upon my tongue making each bite enjoyable. Even my 11 year old son enjoyed it and he\u2019s picky! Relax with some tea and make sure you go with some one that can carry a conversation! You won\u2019t be disappointed. Unless you want microwave fast food- then go to Taco Bell. I ordered the chicken shawarma plate, and it was absolutely delicious, with a great blend of spices. My friend had the falafel, and they loved it as well. It was crispy on the outside and light and fluffy on the inside. I highly recommend this place if you're craving Middle Eastern food. Went here on a whim, it\u2019s located in a strip mall and had great reviews so we popped over.\n\nOur server was very kind! We ordered the tea pot and it was the best tea ever. It may have been Moroccan mint tea, it did not say the kind, but we drank two pots!\n\nI ordered the chicken shawarma plate which was 18 dollars, and my partner order the tuti mix grill which was 25 dollars. Usually I wouldn\u2019t pay 18 dollars for a meal, HOWEVER, it came with hummus, pita bread, salad, rice, seasoned onions, and a huge helping of my choice of protein. I was very satisfied with the flavor of the food and portion size, so I thought the pricing was fair and I didn\u2019t mind at all paying 18 dollars. I had left overs to take home, and our server made a silly joke to me about them charging extra when you don\u2019t finish all the food lol!!\n\nThey also had wraps which were around 12 dollars, so there are smaller and cheaper options too!\n\nGreat experience, kind and attentive staff, amazing food, definitely go try Tuti Grill!! Worth it!"

    "reviews": "If you\u2019re looking for the BEST food, cocktails, and vibe in town \u2013 Angry Chicken is the place you need to visit!\n\nThe food here is absolutely mouth-watering. Every dish we ordered was full of flavor, especially the chicken \u2013 perfectly crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside. You can tell they really care about quality and taste. Everything was cooked to perfection.\n\nThe cocktails were next-level \u2013 super refreshing, creative, and delicious. Each one had its own unique twist, and they were easily some of the best I\u2019ve had anywhere.\n\nThe vibe of the place is just amazing. The music, the lighting, the overall energy \u2013 it\u2019s such a cool and relaxed spot to hang out with friends or even enjoy a chill evening alone.\n\nA huge shoutout to Sunny, who works here \u2013 he truly made the experience even better! He\u2019s so friendly, welcoming, and full of positive energy. He made sure we were comfortable, helped us with great recommendations, and always had a smile on his face.\nI\u2019ll definitely be coming back for the buffet on Sunday \u2013 I\u2019ve heard great things about it and can\u2019t wait to try even more of their amazing food.\n\nOverall, Angry Chicken is a must-visit. Great food, amazing drinks, fantastic service, and the best vibe. Highly recommend it! Good atmosphere. Lots of sauce options. The chicken was REALLY good. We had the original fried chicken with a side of honey garlic and the wings with the sweet and spicy sauce as a side. Next time for the wings I'll try the Buffalo. The SPAM fried rice was perfect. If you\u2019re looking for fresh, halal chicken that\u2019s absolutely delicious, Angry Chicken is a must-try! The chicken was extremely tasty, perfectly crispy, and had that amazing homemade flavor that makes a big difference. Everything tasted super fresh, from the boneless chicken to the bone-in chicken and even the Asian-style chicken like their flavorful biryani chicken.\n\nThe restaurant itself was very clean, with neatly organized tables and a welcoming atmosphere. For just $35, I was impressed with the large and varied selection of chicken options. You can really tell they care about quality and presentation. Visited Angry Chicken again, this time under the new management. The food still tastes just as great as before. We ordered the whole chicken (half original fried, half spicy soy), and it was delicious as always. Noticed a few new Indian fusion items on the menu. The mango shake was refreshing. The place is clean, service was quick and friendly, and we\u2019re already planning to come back for the Sunday buffet. When I tell you the chicken was cooked!!! It was literally still sizzling when it was brought to our table! The chicken biryani was also very good. I liked the mango habanero sauce better when combined with the sweet potato fries."

    "reviews": "Thank Sool was absolutely amazing! I wanted to try everything on the menu so I will definitely be coming back. It\u2019s a little on the pricier side but the food was great. The food came out almost immediately however we were there way before the dinner rush so I\u2019m not sure how fast it would arrive if the restaurant was busy. The flavors were out of this world, I can\u2019t wait to come back and try more dishes. Depending on your preference on skewers or bbq, they'll seat you on the type of table which accommodate the food(s) you'll be ordering. Skewer table comes with the rectangle grill with racks to stack skewers on and BBQ tables have the little stove for the cookoff.\n\nThe service was seriously lacking. I chose skewers and the table I sat on had an incomplete grill setup with a tablet for ordering food. I sat for roughly 10-15 minutes without anybody greeting me or anything to drink. Then the hostess girl came by to set up the grill which she did not know what she was doing and my husband helped her lol. It was obvious that she was the only worker for that entire dining room, hostess/server/busser and etc. So we didn't get enough attention for the entire dining experience. The soju I ordered on tablet when I first sat down did not show up till I almost finished eating because it was forgotten.\n\nNext comes the ordering system. It's easy enough to order food on the tablet but the foods shown on tablet do not come with any explanation. It shows roughly 10 skewers in the photo but only 5 came on a plate, so there's that. Some food items do not come with any photos whatsoever and without an explanation, I did not know what I was ordering or how it looked like.\n\nI ordered lamb and chicken skewers. The grill was not set up correctly which it overcooked food on one side and not cooking food on the other side. So I ended up with meat that's raw on one side and charred on the other. Also the skewers were absolutely the worst ones I've ever had. Very plain and no taste. Skewers, fried chicken and army stew were both very average for the price they charge. I don't mind paying high prices if I'm getting the equivalent services or quality foods to make the money worth it and unfortunately that was not the case. Came here on a Monday night with my wife. Not cheap by any means, food was good, service was good. We got there at about 9PM. It got packed pretty quick. Very cool experience, they opened up the garage doors, had a nice vibe. Will definitely be back whenever I'm in Aurora. Great k-pub for food and drinks. Digital table orders help expedite and everything came out quick and tasty. One of the few places to get jokbal and bossam combo plate. Food was pretty good, we waited a very long time for food to start coming out (almost an hour) and we got there at opening. The service was great, but the prices are extremely steep. We tried a little bit of everything and racked up a nearly 200$ bill fairly quick. You order food and drinks exclusively through an iPad at your table."

    "reviews": "Fun time here for our first karaoke event. Food is just ok. Rooms are private. They do sell alcohol (you can\u2019t bring anything in as they check bags). Very friendly. A bit pricey so make sure to bring max 10 guests to help cost. Great private rooms and drink selections! Staff was very friendly and karaoke equipment was super easy to use. I had never done private room karaoke before and was stoked when my friend told me about this! I think a room was $55/hour and we were there for three. They have a great array of drinks at a reasonable price. The food is more like snacks so I\u2019d eat before hand if you were planning on ordering food .\n\nThe staff was all really fun and likeable and really made the experience that much better! Joe was amazing and such a good time! So friendly and really helped make our time here a five star experience. Other guests at the bar also helped make the night unforgettable! We only ordered fries but they were fresh and hot. Bar had an impressive variety of liquor for it being a karaoke bar. The room was spacious and comfortable. I would definitely recommend this karaoke bar opposed to others in the area like U & I. Thank you so much for having us! We\u2019ll be back soon! My Black and Brown people listen up, please. The front area was very small when me and my friends walked in, and the energy felt like I walked into the wrong house. Everyone was looking at us and a little off energy, if you know what I mean honey. We went to our kareoke room with a broken door and wanted a drink, the guy wouldn't let us check out or know the price of a bottle of Sake, and there weren't any labels for the price or menu we could find! We had a friend from Taiwan with us only second day in America, for the first time. So I got the drink, usually, sake is like $12, so I just expected $30 or so. After singing in the little room, he hands us a $250 bill.... Immma just leave that there for you to decide if this is worth it or nice enough of an experience for that. Now, mind you, my friend from Taiwan visiting had to remove two event's from her first trip here in America because they want to make a scammy and unclear experience for us. I explained the price didn't make sense, and he said we usually get wholesale, so that why we're used to it being cheap. It was giving lightskin and bleach only for me girl. So I personally wouldn't spend your overqualified money on this underqualified experience or at least don't by drinks and especially not rice wine. We love making new connections and wanted to love this place, but it's not possible, very disappointing."

    "reviews": "Large seafood restaurant with most options being huge portions. The fried basket options are more reasonable sizes for a normal appetite. The fried tilapia basket with onion rings was very good and the tartar sauce was a good complement to the fish.\n\nService was very good as well being fast, friendly and helpful. The space is large with decorations appropriate to the food. There is a large bar in the center of the room and a number of TVs. They did not seem to have Wi-Fi.\n\nParking was sufficient. This place was packed! For 2 of us, it was a 40 minute wait but worth it. The Clam Chowder was delicious with a lot of clams. We got the party of 2 boil with the juicy special sauce. It was delicious. The service was excellent! There is a lot of seating inside. This particular visit is worth mentioning\u2026..\nI would like to shout out our server and the manager who assisted me with the issue I had with the oysters.\n\nThe oysters I ordered unfortunately had a hair in one of them.  I actually pulled it out of my mouth \ud83d\ude2b I politely told my server what had happened, showed him the evidence, the manager was notified and promptly got me a new half dozen tray of oysters.\n\nI really appreciated that \ud83d\udc99\n\nEverything else tasted great.\n\nI would like to address the soft shell crab basket.\n\nI would really like your establishment to consider adding at least 2 more pieces of crab. It\u2019s mostly fries, which I think is really underwhelming\u2026 especially for $14 dollars.\n\nI look forward to dining again soon. Tweeks Road Trip Food Review:\nThis is it.. LEGIT cajun boil with crawdads, snow crab, sausage and all the fixings. It was definitely \"juicy seafood\"! I would have given it five stars, but the only different than my own cajun boil is that the seafood wasn't boiled in seasoned or even salted water, it seemed. I get it . You can't cook ALL your shellfish in Zatterans boil (too hot for the locals here in Denver).. but all the flavor seemed like it was on the outside of the shell. Still SUPER YUMMY.. especially if you pay extra for the garlic butter and then dip the shellfish in it, and then in the powdered spice. NOM! NOM! I got hush puppies, 2lbs of snow crab, 1lb of crawfish, and 1/2 lb of sausage.. if I didn't pay an $2.25 for the garlic butter it would have been like $99. Topped out at $101. Ouch.. inflation. This might be a chain, but I don't care if I can get cajun boil like this in the city. I'm so full.. I think I'm going to skip the Uber and WALK back to the hotel! My husband and I went to lunch today and it was delicious. The food was great, it was seasoned just right, food temperature was good, and the size of the meal was more than we expected. Definitely worth it. We recommend this place to anyone who wants great tasty seafood."

The friendly and handsome staff also gave us good directions. We will go back with our friends. Fun place to take the kiddo's to experience this Ramen place.  A little expensive for the add~ons... I know next time to keep them to a minimum.. otherwise clean,  and well stocked We walked in late and the staff was still incredibly friendly and accommodating, helping us get set up with a private room. The drink and food menu had great options, and the karaoke room itself was awesome\u2014filled with lights and a fun vibe. It felt like an authentic Korean karaoke experience. Definitely a spot I\u2019d recommend and come back to! I am so glad I found this place! I had been looking for private karaoke rooms near me for a while. Prices are very reasonable (especially if you go Sun-Thurs) and they have access to any song you want as their system connects to YouTube. They were also very accommodating and took us as a walk in. Had a total blast! Will definitely be coming back soon. \ud83e\udd73 BEST KARAOKE PLACE IN COLORADO! I\u2019ve been to many places before Gangnam opened and this by far has the best food, service, and atmosphere. It\u2019s a huge place with spacious/clean karaoke rooms. The staff are all polite and helpful. Prices are great compared to other karaoke places and there is no extra charge for the youtube connectivity feature. We will definitely be back!!"

    "reviews": "What a lunch or does it also cover breakfast and dinner because I was stuffed.\nThe combination and Korean side dishes were on point.  Service was great!  She was quite helpful with our choice.\nMake reservation as we were seated right away.  We picked a quiet hour and was seated right away.\nTake a leap of faith here as you can\u2019t go wrong unless you didn\u2019t get enough food.  Try anything and everything\nStep out of the box and you won\u2019t regret it. For a \"higher end\" Korean bbq place this service really suffered! The waiter checked on us a total of like 4 times during the entire feast. Forgot about our soups, forgot about our sides, still left him a $40 undeserved tip for a large groupe but definitely not coming back here again with a large group. Tried this place for the first time. We opted to try their entree and appetizer items. The squid stir fry was decent. I wish the sauce was a little more flavorful and spicy. The pork bulgogi was amazing. Super well seasoned and perfectly cooked. The kimchi pancake was a little disappointing. The sauce didn\u2019t really fit too well with the pancake. The fried dumplings were great. It was stuffed with a lot of meat. But the sauce didn\u2019t work too well too. Overall, great service and most of the food was great. I would definitely be coming back to try more options whenever I ever come back. We loved having Yoon Young C as our waitress. Her customer service made our night. She was very attentive and personable. Her presentation was outstanding! She even helped us cook our meat and when we were done helped bag up our food to take home and enjoy. I hope to get her as our waitress next time as well. The food is always amazing here. I\u2019ve tried other Korean restaurants and this place is by far the best. This time we ordered spicy and regular Bulgogi, kimchi soup and chapchae. \ud83e\udd24 just what we needed for an amazing night. The hot tea is such a vibe. We met some friends here for dinner on a Saturday night. We had a reservation so we were seated right away, and the waiter came over quickly to take our order. We ordered the C combination for 7 people and it was the perfect amount of food. Our server answered any questions we had and provided guidance on the menu when needed. It was a great night out, we would definitely return."

And it made me vomit!!!!\ud83e\udd2e Service was friendly and the interior was nice. I did get bahn mi and ate it 5 minutes after getting it. Bread was completely stale hence the 1 star. Im not sure how you assemble the sandwich and not feel stale bread or not care about using stale bread. Also took a long time for only one other customer. Chicken was ok but the veggies were really lacking too. Excellent combination plate.  Delicious marinated meats grilled perfectly. 8/10/23- got a to go order from this place for lunch. They weren't that busy and the food was relatively fast. The overall quality of the food was good. It was on the higher end of the price range when you take size into account. I will be going back to try other things on their menu. My mom's veggie meal had more food in it then my chicken one did. very enjoyable Pho. They\u2019re quick with their service and the quality and quantity is great! I would recommend the combination Pho and Beef fried rice since that\u2019s what we got. Would get again!"

My food was ready soon after I placed the order and was pretty fresh. The bread was a little tough on the ends but I think that's so it holds together when dipped in the olive oil and herbs. I had the Chicken Bryan with penne pasta and an Italian side salad. I found it all very delicious. Service was unbelievably slow, even though we were one table out of, maybe, six total. Both of my beverages, coffee and water were in dirty cups. The window sill we were sat next to was crusted with filth. The server was fantastic. Young kid, but took pride in his job.\nI liked the dishes they offered and the food came out great - can't ever go wrong with pasta!\nThe sauce was well seasoned and the freshly grated cheese brought the dishes together.\n\nThe appetizers were just the right portion and were a nice starter to the meal.\n\nThe ambience of the restaurant was nice and relaxing. Even though it's a chain restaurant, it still has a nice Italian family feel.  I visited at 3pm so they weren't at all busy.  Our server did a great job making sure we had great service.  I had the filet, with spaghetti and broccoli as the two sides.  The filet had great seasoning and was cooked perfectly.  I don't usually like restaurant spaghetti, but theirs had a great flavor and was also very good.  I was pleasantly surprised and would give this restaurant a try! Ordered doordash food came it was cold old and my bf had a piece of metal in his rigatoni called the manager was clueless told me to call and email the GM so I emailed the GM he was apologetic told us to come in to make it right so we did 30 min wait for the waiter to come to our table, never got our soup or salad with our meal manager comes over as we're leaving saying how was it? Terrible!! Don't waste your time or money there was only 5 tables including us and we were forgotten about he had 2 tables shame"

    "reviews": "The vibe was lively but chill. They had a ton of pool tables but unfortunately all 12 or so of them were reserved for leagues. I really dislike when they take up an entire venue for that. Especially when they've got 2 different areas. So how about one area be for that & the other be for regular patrons who want to play, not just sit there & watch. We were hoping to find a new SAFE non rowdy pool hall for the family to visit on weekends but this apparently isn't it. The food was pricey for what it was. Hubby had a pasta, me & my son split a pizza (which was super greasy), and fried ravioli. I had 2 beers and a shot and somehow it was almost $80. We can take us plus our 2 adult children out to play pool with pitchers, plenty of food, shots & table time for less than that at a similar place we've been going to around the corner. So we won't be back. The server was nice. But unless you just wanna watch people play pool and over pay on mediocre food, I'd pass on this place. They've got nice tables, too bad we couldn't play on them. Also, kids aren't allowed to play on the tables. Our 8 year old loves playing but guess he won't be here. Also, the reviews I read lied. They don't have a kids menu. And I wouldn't call this a family friendly place. Because it literally was just full of league players and some old bar flys. Also, my Palisades Peach draft didn't taste right. Pretty sure she gave me the wrong beer. They also didn't even have pickle shots or a pickle back for my vodka. What bar doesn't have pickle juice? Oh, a league club disguised as an Italian restaurant, that's who. Piazza's is the best place for Pool Tournaments in Denver right now.\n\nIf you stop in, I recommend trying their pasta or pizza. Their Italian food is very tasty. I make sure to get pasta every time. The atmosphere was a little bit of a weird vibe. There was a pool tournament going on so it was very quite and serious. It wasn't a welcoming feeling. The server was nice but the drinks weren't made right. And the food could've been better. But it seems like more of a pool hall. They had a million pool tables to play on. So it seems great if your interested in getting involved in a pool league. This place was really good! We happened to stumble in during the championship and the bar was packed. Even then we were seated fast and our server, who I think might have also been the owner, was super nice and fast. The food was really good. Even as busy as it was it was obvious they cared about the quality of their product. I entirely intend on going back and playing some pool! They have a bunch of pool tables. All in all really happy with this place. A little difficult to rate. The location is a bit odd but works if you are looking for something in that part of Aurora. The pool tables are popular and appear to be the primary reason folks go here although it is a bar with food. The food was pretty average for bar food. It's perfect for when you're craving something cheesy and oily, but doesn't really stand out enough on its own if you are looking for a restaurant. The staff were friendly and the restrooms were adequate. I believe you pay by the hour for the pool tables but I went with a group so I'm not completely sure. If you're looking for a casual pool hall, give this a try."

Service was amazing and so friendly. Thank you now pho ! Definitely will be back ! I really like to come to Pho Now more after upgrading many new dishes and drinks. Delicious food, friendly staff. My favorite dishes are fried dough, noodles grilled pork . Pho \ud83e\ude77 Now Ph\u1edf serves the best Hue Noodle Soup in Denver, packed with flavor. The beef shank and pork hock are so tender and juicy. I like their blood cube, well seasoned that bursts into flavorful juice when we crust into it. The shrimp chili oil elevates the whole experience, salty enough that blends well into the slightly sweet broth. The staff are so kind and friendly. We can\u2019t wait to be back to try other items in their signature section After dining at many pho restaurants in town, always thought most are quite similar with nothing in particular to mention about. Was quite impressed by the offering at Now Pho on South Federal though. Besides less common dishes such as the stone bowl pho, oxtail pho, filet mignon pho and wagyu beef pho and specialty noodle soups, even many traditional mainstays tasted quite good. Ordered the rare steak, tendon and tripe pho, the meatball pho and grilled shrimp and Kobe beef spring rolls. The broth was very flavorful, but not oily or salty. The tendon was in chunks and well done. The meatballs were plenty and bouncy. The texture of vermicelli noodles was more chewy than what I expected. Besides the chewy noodles and rice paper wrap, the smoky taste of the grilled shrimps and Kobe beef in the spring rolls was another highlight. The Vietnamese coffee was in paper cup, although the taste was rich and authentic, but would be even better if more traditionally prepared through a phin filter. Overall, very satisfied and in my opinion, one of the best if not the best pho restaurant in town. We ordered catering from Now Pho for our party last weekend with fried rice and chicken salad. Everybody loves the food and raves about how delicious they are. Very high quality and they do not skimp on meat and ingredients. Now Pho truly exceeds our expectations from food quality, presentation and delivery. We now know where to place order for our next party"

Amazing space, great community, and definitely my favorite spot for trivia. I love the idea of getting veggies grown in my neighbor's yards. Everything about this cozy spot was great.\nService was a solid 10/10, and the coffee selection and flavor were on point. The grilled cheese was fresh and reasonably priced and definitely a highlight that helped offset the cook\u2019s attitude when I politely asked if it could be made to-go.\n\nThe location is well placed, and the atmosphere inside is warm, inviting, and relaxing. A great little place to unwind. The food was fantastic. The staff/owners were friendly. The place was clean.\nThey were hosting an event to support a non-profit.\nIf you want good food, a friendly atmosphere, and support a place that supports its community, then this is a place for you.\n\nOh, and I put the thumbprint in my bun and then remembered to take a pic. The plate was prettier upon arrival. Stumbled across this little gem after getting my emissions test. The food is nothing to write home about, but the coffee selection is good. The best part though, is the incredibly well-curated taplist of local craft beers. This might be the best rotating selection of craft beers I've seen in Denver. The service is excellent as well; Julie is a delight. Great, quiet atmosphere with plenty of space to work on your laptop. Easy parking, and very family friendly.\nDid I just find my new favorite spot? I think so \ud83d\ude0e"

    "reviews": "I dream about this fish. This is my favorite fish and chips spot. I never cared for fried fish before, but this is a life altering experience in taste. The fish is fresh, buttery and soft, the breading is light and crunchy, and the house made tartar sauce is a thing of  beauty.\nThis location is in a classic antique building and the dining area has beautiful wood tables probably just as old. No frills, simple and clean, with sports on the TV and the bliss of perfectly fried food. \ud83d\udcaf This was my first visit to GB fish and chips. I\u2019ve seen a lot of their ads on Instagram and that other social media platforms and I\u2019ve been dying to try it.\n\nWell today, I did just that.  If you\u2019re looking for a high end restaurant serving fish you better keep looking.\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for a place that offers a great menu awesome fresh food great service and a clean restaurant. This is absolutely where you need to be.\n\nI chose the half cod meal and chips. It came with a drink. I also had to have some bread pudding, which was pretty remarkable.\n\nThe staff was absolutely awesome, friendly and fun. I will certainly be back support local. This fish and chips restaurant has been on South Broadway for a very long time. They serve excellent food. I stopped in today on a whim and they had haddock as a special. They served a piece of fish that was gigantic. It was absolutely delicious and perfectly prepared. I highly recommend this restaurant if you are a fan of fish and chips. Such a great place for fish n chips.\nDrove all the way from Dallas, TX because I heard about this place online. Such amazing staff and atmosphere \u2764\ufe0f\nHighly highly recommend! Good food, simple as that. I believe it's super hard to find even decent food in Colorado, so when I find a gem it's a blessing. GB fish and chips are pretty authentic, the taste is similar to what I've had in GB.\n\nMeal was 3 pieces of COD and a basket of steak fries minus the extra seasons and came out to $14 bucks great deal imo."

Such a kind guy and I can tell he\u2019s really passionate about brewing. We tried all the beers and they are delicious and some unique flavors too! The atmosphere is chill and has fun music. Highly recommend this brewery! I\u2019ll definitely be coming back! Ornate bar that draws the goers. I chose the Velvet Aperture (6.9%, collaboration with Full Frame Brewing). Has a mildly good finish of orange zest and chocolate, and some hints of a traditional dunkel.\n\nAlso had a great interior decor, airy atmosphere with a pleasant bartender. Loved the juicy IPA on a couch with a bonsai tree view. Cool decor and a mellow atmosphere. Worth checking out! This is a delicious addition to Denver's brewery scene. The welcoming atmosphere pairs well with their wide variety of draft beers. It's now on my regular stops list. Great space, great people. Creative brews, love the loads of collab efforts. The house coffee blonde and the chili beer are seriously killer! Give the empanadas and hot sauces a shot, won't regret it. Has some shared/allocated non-street parking (something of a premium, really, so much appreciated)."

    "reviews": "Went to this burger spot in Denver with a great location. Prices were solid, definitely fair for what you get. The burger itself was really good, not the best I\u2019ve had in the city, but still worth the visit. It was super crowded though, we had to wait around 20 minutes for a table. Service was okay, nothing special. Overall, it\u2019s a good spot, not mind-blowing, but if you're nearby, it's a solid choice. I really love this park burger. They have many unique burger recipes to try. My husband and I have had all but one. If you are a burger fan I would definitely suggest giving it a try. The servers are very nice and take good care of you. For the Denver area the service is 5 stars. Great burger only got a 4 because it's impossible to park and personally I believe fries should come with the burger other than that it was wonderful The green chili burger was really good, and I loved the jalapeno cream cheese on there. The works fries were really good and loved the cheese on there, too. We were looking for a local burger joint to try. We came across Park Burger and it mostly delivered. The aesthetic could be described as a low key hipster diner. Not bad, but not anything new or unique.\nThe burger offerings are your standard fare with a twist. I had the Cracked Pepper burger. The waitress informed us that they cook their patties to medium. The burger patty itself was pretty bland. But this burger was more than the sum of it's parts. Bites with each component were good, but nothing to scream from the hilltops about.\nOur waitress was friendly and happy to explain more of the menu and chat with us.\nIf you like burgers and are in the area, it's worth checking out. However, I wouldn't put this on a list of 'destination' restaurants."

We stopped by after a birthday celebration for a drink. I was very happy to see they had gluten free cider by Schilling! I loved the live music, so much fun The fries are the best I have found across a few states...I highly recommend King Cake daiquiri, PB&J Sour, and Swamp water for cocktails!!  The red beans & rice has fantastic flavor, too We had a blast in this bar when we were visiting Denver. Awesome blues band and atmosphere on Friday night. Our waitress was sweet but I think she was overwhelmed attending all the tables, and she forgot our food. We waited for more than an hour. At least was a good wait thanks to the music and the fact that we weren\u2019t super hungry. The Gumbo soup was tasty, but the salad was whatever. Even though we had a great time with the music and the happy crowd dancing, super good vibes, we will come back for that. During the noon hour on a weekday, there was a total of 9 diners there, including the 2 of us. The server/bartender was very pleasant and efficient.  The atmosphere is what you would expect given the type of place it is.  Honestly, I was pleased to see that it has hardly changed in appearance since I used to frequent it as the C&G in the 1960's. What great memories!  Our food was disappointing.  My blackened catfish was tasty enough but very soggy.  Red beans and rice were just okay but served luke warm.  I did enjoy the hush puppies.  My wife, who is actually from New Orleans, was disappointed in the shrimp po-boy sandwich.  While the serving was ample, the bread just doesn't measure up to an authentic po-boy sandwich.  I might return for a beer but not to eat lunch.  All in all, we did not feel Lincoln's Roadhouse deserves to call itself a \"Cajun cafe.\""

We are right there with the never stop moving bartender. Great service. Not a big selection of food but still great food. Had the Nashville Bites and a Bird Enchilada. Big wine selection. Loved the atmosphere of this place- Pearl street is always a fun place and this restaurant and bar doesn\u2019t disappoint. Service was wonderful. Drinks were delicious and so was the food. We went for breakfast and enjoy every bite. Felt pretty affordable for everything we got. Loved this place! We shared the pretzel bites w beer cheese as an appetizer and each got mimosas. Our server Day was awesome! My friend got the classic Benedict and I got the burrito. Everything tasted amazing and the vibe was great :) can\u2019t wait to come back and try more of the menu!\n\nBonus points: it\u2019s right down the street from my favorite ice cream place (sweet cow)"

The location is good, but parking can be tricky depending on the time. Food quality is good, but portions are small and prices feel a bit high. Service was disappointing \u2014 staff wasn\u2019t rude, but they were cold and robotic, missing the usual warm vibe you expect from Latin places. Worth visiting once to try their empanadas, but I probably wouldn\u2019t return often or perhaps at all. What a great experience today Maria Empanada (Broadway)! Yummy empanadas and coffee.\nIt is really cool how they are able to stamp the name of the empanada directly on it.\n\nAtmosphere was comfortable, relaxed, great staff, and I was able to get work done while I ate.\n\nDefinitely recommend \u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\n\n#supportlocal #supportlocalbusiness My first time visiting. Great vibe for sure. The service culture doesn\u2019t match. Nice but very clinical. Not warm and welcoming.  Dry. Robotic. Food was pricy for size. Very good quality. Very clean spot. Refills are difficult as there is only one server at a time. I\u2019m not sure we are invited to tip counter employees. It was a good one time trip. The staff was extremely kind. We had super great hospitality, we felt right at home. Atmosphere is great. Empanadas taste like a slice of heaven. Can't recommend enough! We had a handful for empanadas and the staff gave us some free sauce samples since it was our first time in! All empanadas were incredible and the sauces are a lovely complement! We had the Denver passport which is what brought us in, sangria's were yummy. Great empanadas! I tried the Ham and Cheese and the Chorizo. Both had good flavor. The hot chocolate was great too!"

The people there are very welcoming as soon as you walk in! Top 5 favorite in Denver! A must! If you are in the Denver area. The vibes of this restaurant made you feel so good. Ben, the owner waits on you!\nTotally delightful. The other staff are warm and welcoming but, come here for the food. The presentation is beautiful, and the food is outstanding. We've been coming here since we moved to Denver 3 years ago and we can't get enough. The food quality continues to impress. The atmosphere is welcoming. Plus, the owners and employees take the time to know us. 10/10 every time. Amazing place with cool vibes and great staff. The service was personable and attentive. We already were at 5 stars without even touching on the food and drinks. The food is unique with tons of flavor and there's options for everyone! Best yet, they have a dog friendly and heated (yes!) patio. Our pups received the same amazing service. Highly recommend and can't wait to come back. \u00a1Dios mio! And oh my god, so good! My chilqquiles and cafe de olla were the perfect mix of light, fresh and earthy soul food. Little touches like Mexican style cheeses and thinly sliced poblanos tells ya that the kitchen knows what they're doing. Plateware like you find in abuela's kitchen (mine at least!) brought it home for me. Adjacent to S. Pearl, Wash Park & University neighborhoods."

Nixon's is a coffee shop with so much more! They have a great selection of different coffee, tea, and kombucha on tap. It's a great space, that's bright, clean, and inviting. Overall, a great space to work, meet a friend, or just pick up a little treat (or two!).\n\nThe ice chai latte was fantastic and the hibiscus mint kombucha was at refreshing!\n\nGreat staff that were really nice, funny, and patient!\n\nI'll be back to try more kombucha varieties! It was great to grab a cup of joe, sit in the the sunny window, and enjoy life for a little while today! Coffee was excellent! I had the sugar cookie latte. My wife and I are in from FL for a couple weeks and decided to try the local Denver coffee house vibe. This morning we had the absolute pleasure of enjoying Nixon's in the Wash Park area. From the moment we walked in we felt the love. Love for peeps and love for what they do, making great coffee creations and yummy eats! We've visited over a dozen local spots so far...Nixon's is tops. Thanks to Caren, Brad, and all their team! Serves delicious coffe in any form you like it, drip cold brew, on tap etc etc etc. I like to get the venetian cream once in awhile as a super sweet creamy treat!"

    "reviews": "Excellent pizza with high quality ingredients.  The sour dough crust is so delicious and there are traditional to very unique toppings.  The pepperoni rolls were one of the best things I have eaten in a while.   The cocktail menu had some unique cocktails.  I have been working my way through Denver's top pizza list and this is at the top of my list!   There is also a great patio. First of all, the pizza is some of the best in Denver. Tons of great topping choices, vegan options, and delicious apps and creative drinks. But after our last visit, we definitely have a special connection to this place. My fiancee and I shot our engagement photos here a couple months ago (the inside is so cozy and the ambiance/atmosphere is immaculate), and not only were the staff incredibly accommodating of our shoot, but they reached out to us afterward to congratulate us on our engagement, which was so thoughtful! We ended up going back on a date night, and they recognized us and greeted us with the most kind, friendly service I've ever received at a restaurant. Truly blown away by the level of care everyone brings to their jobs here. If you want an incredible meal while being surrounded by exceptionally kind people, this is your spot! We'll definitely be back! Get the 70\u2019s pie and Elote pizza and it is a must to sit on the patio in the evening! The beet salad is also a must try, great vibe and staff. If you like pizza and beer you must go here. Joy Hill is a must! It's our go-to for delicious pizza in a great, warm and welcoming setting. Great drinks, friendly service and staff, down to earth. Super awesome patio. 10 out of 10. Visiting Joy Hill on Galentine\u2019s Day was an absolute delight! I made a reservation in advance, and Brittany, the GM, went above and beyond to ensure everything was perfect. She secured great seating for us (though, honestly, every spot in this cozy atmosphere is fantastic), pre-selected our wine, and even made sure my partner\u2019s flowers were beautifully placed on the table before our arrival.\n\nAs we walked in, everything was set up perfectly, bringing a huge smile to my partner\u2019s face. Our server, Rachel, greeted us with warmth and a welcoming attitude, providing exceptional service throughout the evening. She was attentive without being intrusive\u2014our water glasses stayed full, our wine glasses never empty, and she made sure we had everything we needed to truly enjoy our meal.\n\nWe ordered the arugula Caesar salad (one as a vegan option), bison meatballs, Tuscan tomato soup, and the Mushroom Sally pizza to share. Each dish arrived fresh, hot, and bursting with flavor\u2014everything was truly exceptional. We never felt rushed or overlooked, and the extra touches throughout the night made the experience even more special. To top it off, multiple staff members checked in to ensure we were enjoying ourselves, which added to the warm and inviting atmosphere.\n\nThank you, Joy Hill & Team, for your incredible hospitality and for making our evening so memorable. We felt the LOVE!"

It was divine. 10/10 recommend this dish to try a little bit of everything!\n\nFor drinks we had a Mango creamy drink and a Limonada  Cartagenera . Both delicious. The Mango drink was my favorite.\n\nWe took home a Tres Leches cake & Batido de Cafe \ud83e\udd24.\n\nAlso, we called ahead to see if dogs were allowed in the patio seating and they are! Best to call ahead though, just in case. The restaurant is beautiful and the patio was perfect. They have a really great spot. This is a good similarity to a restaurant you would find in a non touristy area of Colombia.  Typical dishes, same music, familiar environment.  We were all happy with our choices.  Bandeja Paisa, Sobrebarriga,  Pescado, y Sopa.  The food, environment,  service, and prices were good.  If you were in Colombia however, you would spend a quarter of the price in dollars. Great experience! We had generous portions of delicious food and enjoyed the restaurant ambience with the patios (front and back) nicely decorated.  They serve delicious authentic Colombian food (If you haven\u2019t tried Colombian food is not spicy but you can add \u2018aj\u00ed\u2019 the local hot sauce if you want). Every plate was very flavorful, there were a few of us and we had different steaks, bandeja (typical plate with ground beef, beans, chicharr\u00f3n, etc),  parrilla (mix plate of meats), and soup, and all were delish. We pair our food with mojitos (recommend the one with a fruit call maracuy\u00e1), margaritas and beer, but they do have fruit juices too. The service was great, very friendly and with good suggestions.  Nice background music, with a good level so you were still able to carry a conversation. We came for the food, but the patio sitting really added a sprinkle to the full experience.  Fully recommend it! An almost great experience. The downs come first which would be that the \"Paisa\" is only served with ground beef not carne asada (if you order it with the steak it's an additional charge) which is  normally and either/or situation. The steak was a bit on the raw side even though I hadn't asked for it that way. That's really the only issue I had. The Service was great there were plenty of waitresses that were willing to help each other so it was great. The desserts were incredible, the guava bread was INCREDIBLE!!!.The MILHOJAS incredible...so yeah basically if you have a sweet tooth go ahead and try it out. Thank you for An amazing experience."

Great experience! Service was great and there was only one bartender and she was on it! Very friendly atmosphere, food was good and will definitely be returning! We just wanted to try a new place after work and found this was not the place. The food was good but the service definitely needs work. Not only were we treated rudely because we were younger a comment was even made about how young we were to be there, our order was not completed by the first waitress who never gave her name nor was wearing a name tag, she got our drinks and appetizers before taking the menus and walking away, we still were trying to order an actual meal. She also switched halfway through our meal with another waitress even though it was not very busy. We were also charged full price during happy hour. Also you may want to take a look at your menus as we were given 2 different ones with different prices and some different items."

Waited 15 mins past pick up time for this bs, smallest wings in history not even wing stop does this lol. Mind you this was 17$ for 10 wings; it\u2019s like they gave me the scraps. Just go to wing stop Overall, this was fairly disappointing. The teriyaki traditional wings were overcooked and the sauce was very sweet. I probably would have been better off ordering a sandwich.\n\nService was a bit slow but otherwise fine. The space is very large with lots of TVs showing various sports. They did have the sound on for a soccer match but you really couldn't tell what they were saying due to the general level of conversations going on. It would have been better with the sound off. They do have unsecured Wi-Fi for customers.\n\nThere is sufficient parking. My husband and I were sat at our table for 20 minutes and no sever even acknowledged us paid us no mind. I am a server, no one seemed to be in the weeds or scrambling around. There were servers SITTING DOWN WATCHING THE GAME. This was been the most ridiculous thing I\u2019ve ever experienced 6/7/2025 right when the fighting started and stayed till after the match was over. The food and service were amazing! Our server Kong went out of his way to ensure we understood everything on the menu and he even gave us some recommendations which ended up tasting delicious. He checked in on us regularly and overall made our experience amazing."

    "reviews": "Standard Applebee's menu adjusted for Mother's Day. The Bourbon Street Steak was perfectly cooked to order (Medium Rare). The onions, mushrooms and garlic mashed potatoes that came with it were also very good. I don't think the cherry limeade is on the menu anymore, but they made one for me anyway.  It was perfect for a hot day.\n\nService was excellent. Chelsea was prompt, friendly, attentive and informative. The space is nice and broken up so you don't feel crowded. They have some TVs mainly in the bar area. They do have unsecured Wi-Fi for customers.\n\nParking is not a problem, although when it's particularly busy you may not be close. gotta love the service. this location was the best. I had someone serving us but was still in training, he didn't even need a trainer, so attentive. asked the appropriate questions right away. no delay in service. shout out to the trainers/managers here. your work shows Me and my mother came to your restaurant the other day and we're waiting on by the most amazing lady. Her name Is Traci Stembel. She answered all our questions about the menu she was very accommodating. Very attentive and had a pleasant personality. She made us feel right at home and it wasn't like a restaurant experience it was like being with a family member. Keep up the good work on your staff Jamie the Blonde Bar Tender Absolutely TERRIBLE!!!\n\nNever had worse service.. I hate writing bad reviews\n\nOn everything I love we had to have servers switched gave him $20 just because\n\nAll because she hasn't gotten any in over 10 Years\n\nStay Away from Karen A buddy and I came in recently for lunch. Traci was our server.  She did an outstanding job. It wasn\u2019t super busy but we noticed she had several other tables. It didn\u2019t matter. We weren\u2019t waiting long for anything. My buddy likes a weird mix of things for his fries and she got it right away with a smile!  KUDOS!"

    "reviews": "Always love coming here! Ms. Rosario, Ms. Natalia & Ms. Anna are always so friendly & attentive to the customers with smiles on their faces that light up the room! Food is always in good servings & definitely will have leftovers for later! Thank you guys as always! Que being awesome!\ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffd\ud83e\udd0c\ud83c\udffd\ud83e\udd1f\ud83c\udffd Stopped by Qdoba today and was so impressed by M\u00fda and Christian. They were working on the holiday and still provided excellent service with a smile. It was very nice to see their dedication. Thank you both! Hope corporate sees this and rewards their hard work with a raise. I'll be returning soon. Every Saturday morning, my family and I eagerly anticipate our visit to QDOBA at Garden in Aurora. The moment we step through the doors, the friendly team greets us warmly, often recalling our usual orders, which adds a personal touch to our dining experience.\n\nThe breakfast menu is a highlight, with the breakfast burritos and bowls being our top choices.The restaurant maintains a spotless environment, and the inviting atmosphere makes it a perfect spot for family gatherings or meals with friends.\n\nFor anyone seeking a delightful breakfast spot with exceptional service, I wholeheartedly recommend QDOBA  on Garden. Their commitment to customer satisfaction and delicious offerings make it a standout choice in Aurora. Natalia and Ana are amazing. Always come here on our break even if a different location is closer to work just because of the amazing service. Food is always very tasteful and hot, not sitting there for a while or cold! Will continue to come here!! I eat at Qdoba from time to time\u2026 I was craving one of their surf and turf bowls - Shrimp and steak- I added the fajita veggies along with the corn salsa, pico d gallo and another spicy cream sauce with the white rice and black beans. The employees had an issue with a customer and handled it like champions. The restaurant was very clean inside and outside. The manager told me that this location is the busiest they have in the area. I will be back soon to partake in the great food and great service at this location. I highly recommend stopping by this location if you are in the area and craving a great meal."

    "reviews": "Great place to chill and play some pool. The vibe is right, food is good, drinks are flowin.  Large portions too. They've got great prices and specials throughout the week. And free pool during the weekdays with purchase of food/drinks. I love that this place isn't too rowdy. The main bar area is separate from the pool table area with some other games back there too & dining area. We bring our whole family for chill pool playing & a good time. After 5pm it's over 21 only. The food was amazing, and the drinks were made to perfection. Plus, the free pool was absolutely a fun time. We haven't been here in over a decade but found the service to be exemplary and the food outstanding. The steak sandwich and tacos were some of the best ever. My wife and I have been here at least twice as of this review and we absolutely love this place to have some drinks/food and play some pool. We go during the week when the pool tables are free so we can play as much as we want. So far the food is very good and the only issues with the atmosphere we have is when no one pays for music it's very weirdly quiet. Ive been in a few times with slow service but this will be my last. After walking in and being acknowledged by the bartender, I waited as the bar was continually served while we waited. Eventually left after other staff walked past and didn't even give us a menu. Sad this used to be my favorite spot, now they don't even utilize the 2 bars they have. Good luck getting service in here if the bars full. You'll apparently have to get it at the bar yourself, and dont forget to tip"

    "reviews": "I can\u2019t figure out why my burrito smells like Murphy\u2019s Oil Soap or some sort of detergent in the bag. That was not very enticing and unappetizing\u2026 the staff were fine and helpful but smelling detergent is not an appealing part of ordering food\u2026 The GM Adalid and the assistant Manager Joshua, provided the best customer service I have experienced in the many years of my patronizing QDOBA. They both displayed the type of attitude that makes customers feel valued and appreciated. I hope to see them again in the near future. Absolutely horrible service. I walked in the store and was not greeted nor helped for five minutes after entering the store. Whole staff needs training. I was started at as they continued to have there conversations . The female who was supposed to be manager was rude. She wasn\u2019t listening and out the wrong stuff on my bowl i asked a new one to be made instead of her taking it off like she was doing and she made a big deal and told me to speak up when asking what i want on my bowl. She has horrible customer service and im sure you guys would not someone like her representing qdoba. She needs to be re trained and made sure she\u2019s following qdobas expectations. Missed the mark. They looked slammed on the pick up orders but not much attention to customers as the line moved slow.  Was extremely disappointed to see the mini bowl I ordered had a lot less meat than a kids nachos that was ordered. I asked for a little shredded cheese and the employee threw half a handful on. I asked for a lot if guacamole and the employee threw on a level scoop.  To top it off the food seemed a bit cold and chips undercooked and the dining area needed to be cleaned. Even after the bowl was closed with aluminum foil and reopened you can still see part of the bowl lacking any ingredients. I don't go to this location much but doubt I'll be returning anytime soon. There are much better Qdobas locations out there. The guy named Joshua who was there tonight 11/21 was absolutely amazing. I say this because I was a difficult customer asking for the veggies but no onions and he made sure to not get any onions in my bowl and when he did, he made sure to take it out. Thank you Joshua for your great customer services. The other employees that were there tonight as well, thank you for your kindness and patience."

I am a lyft/uber driver. I find myself trying new local places whenever I can. I showed up here after searching this place on google and wasnt sure if they were open so I called to make sure. I say down at the bar, asked for a glass of water along with the Mexiburger with onion rings on the side and an order of chips and salsa\n\nThe salsa and chips were good and fresh, she asked how I would like my burger cooked, I asked for Medium rare. When my burger arrived it was 100% rare inside not even close to medium rare. I spent the first 8 years of my adulthood cooking for a living so I definitely know a meats temp when I see it.\n\nI informed her I could not eat it because it was rare. She rebuttled by saying \"well I put it in as medium rare\". I told her I trusted that she put it in correct but that this is rare. She took my plate back and had them remake it. It came back well done this time but thats a lot better than a raw burger with sear marks on the outside.\n\nI have said thank you for bringing me my food twice now, and thanks for refilling my water, she completely ignored me, absolutely no acknowledgement of me trying to be kind and courteous despite my disdain for the rare burger. She then brought me my receipt in the middle of eating my order, of course she said no rush. But that action alone changes your minds behavior. She sat on her phone 90% of the time I was here and I feel like I was judged based on my appearance of what I was wearing, (dirty sweats, paint covered hoodie).\n\nI would never eat here again for the horrible customer service, and the burger was overseasoned to boot. I dont reccomend this place to anybody that doesnt look \"wealthy\".\n\nNormally I tip 25% or more, but this is seriously making me only want to tip a dollar on an $18 order. Which I will. Service can be a little slow but it's worth it. Great place, comfy atmosphere, variety of foods. Wings are great and the reuben rolls are awesome. Community Tavern that closes between 8 and 8:30 which is a little early.  Come here for a few drinks and conversation, but don't come for the food.  It could use a lot of improvement in my opinion.  Good people here though. We have gone too Murphy Creek tavern for breakfast for years.  However this visit my friend ordered corned beef hash breakfast.  It looked like it came out of a can. Actually I'm pretty sure it did.  The biscuits and gravy were okay but there was only one biscuit.  The eggs that we ordered we asked for over easy and got over medium.  Unfortunately probably not be coming back for breakfast.  Not a bad place, just maybe just an off day."

They say greatness takes time and the food is definitely worth a short wait\u2026\n\nYou can tell the pride they take daily in every dish\u2026.\n\nI went out of my comfort zone of food but was guided with grace and kindness to what I really enjoyed\u2026\n\nI\u2019ll definitely be back I visited African Grill and Bar on a Friday evening around 6:30 PM, and was immediately seated, which was a pleasant surprise given the usual weekend rush. The service was efficient, and our server was warm and attentive throughout our meal.\n\nFor dinner, I ordered the oxtail with jollof rice and spinach stew, while my husband went with the kebab served with spicy jerk stew. Both dishes were packed with flavor, and you could tell that the ingredients were fresh and carefully prepared. The oxtail was tender and perfectly cooked, complementing the rich jollof rice and hearty spinach stew. My husband's kebab had a nice smokiness to it, and the spicy jerk stew gave it a nice kick without overpowering the flavors.\n\nWe also tried the fried plantain, which was crispy on the outside and soft on the inside\u2014an excellent side that paired perfectly with our dishes.\n\nOverall, the food was absolutely delicious, and the staff was very friendly, making the entire dining experience enjoyable. I would definitely recommend African Grill and Bar for anyone craving authentic African flavors in Lakewood! The service was ok. The atmosphere was clean, inviting, just smaller than expected. The food, though, was good! For the price, I expected the portions to be bigger, but I'd assume the ingredients required make the price. It's definitely worth the drive if you are craving fufu. If you desire authentic African cuisine. This is the place. Lunch or dinner, you're bound to find a delectable gem  on the menu that will satiate your taste buds.   I enjoyed the Chai and the hibiscus ginger juice that I ordered with my meal. The best restaurant I've EVER been too. Great atmosphere great people and AMAZING food. Some of the best I've had ever and at least the best I've had since I've moved out to Denver and honestly the best restaurant I've ever been too.\n\nI can't say enough to truly get out how I feel. So I'll leave it with the sentiment I gave my friends when I couldn't eat another bite. \"My Stomach is full but my heart isn't\" I just wish I could have kept eating more and more."

    "reviews": "Wondered into this great neighborhood bar and grill on a Friday early evening. It was already pretty crowded and not too many empty seats or tables. Friendly service and the crowd is a bit older, not a college-age type of a place. I had my 11-year old son with me, but didn't see too many other kids or children. Food prices are very reasonable - 24 wings, 5 chicken tenders, two soft drinks = $25 plus tax and tip. Loud music in the background and lots of drinking and laughing/good times all around. There's a patio for outdoor seating and a pool table as well. Pretty down to earth place and very enjoyable. Bonus: a few Harley Davidson motorbikes parked in the lot to check out. Recommended! Hands down the best wings I have tried so far since I got to CO 5 years ago. Wingstop will never see me again. Lemon pepper and buffalo \ud83d\ude2e\u200d\ud83d\udca8\ud83d\ude2e\u200d\ud83d\udca8 I \ud83e\udd24\ud83e\udd24 I meant to upload a picture of the wings but they were so freaking good I forgot.\n\nKeep it up, guys \ud83e\udee1\ud83d\udc4c\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb It is a local bar not to far from the neighborhood we came cause they had great wing reviews...I had sweet and spicy buffalo he had garlic parm and honey spicy garlic...crispy...THEY GOT IT RIGHT FASHO I Will Definitely Come back..He love Him some Wings and Now He know Where to Go The food is always great here and their drinks are good but it does take a while for your food to come out but it's always hot. They cater more to their regulars. If you don't go there that often, you really don't get that good of service, but they are nice when they come to your table. It will take longer for someone to come to your table to give you service. They really don't pay attention to you if you're not a regular.  You will see the workers go to people that they know and do shots with them. All while ignoring your table. The atmosphere is good. I've never seen anyone fighting or causing issues. Classic dive with pool tables & lots of TVs for games. Food is top notch for bar food & service is always friendly & pretty quick. Wings are very good & you cannot find them cheaper. Everything is made fresh to order."

She is the understatement of the year if you call her special.\n\nP.S. I have recently returned to the bar Rome\u2019s Saloon. Let me tell you - This place has stepped it up to an entirely new level.  With Alexa and Lindsey behind the bar, I\u2019d bet my life savings that there isn\u2019t a better starting lineup.  This is McGuire/Canseco levels of elite service.  If you are reading this from any other establishment, walk out on your tab and get over here.  Denver\u2019s best.\n\nP.P.S.   Still here, major update.  Learning a lot about the ins and out of this establishment.  Morning crew, 1 star\u2026 potential for less.  Night crew, give them an award for being the absolute greatest humans on earth.  17/5 stars.\n\nP.P.P.S. I\u2019m currently in Manhattan, Kansas.  I find myself judging the security in every place I walk into.  I don\u2019t feel safe without Matt.  Basically, if I\u2019m not at Rome\u2019s, I wish I was at Rome\u2019s.\n\nP.P.P.P.S I have spent time away from my family, traveling to far off places in the Midwest.  Yet, as my plane landed back in Denver, my first choice wasn\u2019t to go straight home\u2026 Actually, if \u201chome\u201d truly is where your heart is;, then I did, in fact, go home.  I\u2019m back at the locally owned and run business known as Rome\u2019s Saloon.  My plane landed and my plan of treating my hard working wife to world class wings to go couldn\u2019t possibly be going better.  Before I could even finish my standard 5lb beer and 1oz Irish whiskey, delivered by the most premium staff in America, my perfectly packed food was expertly prepared and ready for me to treat my family and myself to a night at home.  The kitchen staff is the unsung hero of this place. What they are accomplishing here can\u2019t be understated. Moving David to a role behind the scenes, although difficult for me to not see him regularly, was the correct move. Obviously - Mistakes don\u2019t exist in the Romes universe. I will eventually stop being surprised when they go beyond what is expected. 18/10, zero notes.  Google needs to add an option for more stars, if only for this particular location on earth. I like the concept. The food (wings and nachos) were not good for me. The wings were swimming in sauce rather than being crispy and tossed. The blue cheese was like pure mayo with blue cheese crumbles. I couldn't touch it. Nachos had pickled chilies on it instead of fresh, and it just got soggy. it just wasn't for me. That said I'll call it the obvious. the staff are very pretty and look good in their outfits. Like I said, I like the concept \ud83d\ude09 This bar is the pure essence of Merica. They don't serve beer, they serve bottled bald eagle piss. They don't serve wings, they serve deep-fried freedom. This would still be the most American bar on Earth if it were located in Wuhan China. This bar cultivates the following images in the mind: George W. Bush eating a brisket sandwich in the bed of his Ram 2500 Laramie. A 10-gallon hat filled to the brim with sweet tea. A fried chicken breast getting blasted to bits by an AR15. Et cetera. Stop by and have a drink unless you're a commie. The food was ok, the chicken cordon blu I got was good but the fries that came with it were burnt. If you are going just for beer and the amazing staff it seems like a great place. A staple in this neighborhood for decades... Great bar... Good Burritos and green chili... Good pretzel bites... Italian sausage sandwich.."

The food was phenomenal \u2013 creative, flavorful, and clearly made with love. You can taste the dedication to quality and sustainability in every bite.\nBeyond the incredible food, the vibe is just perfect. The space is absolutely gorgeous, both inside and out, creating a really warm and inviting atmosphere. It's the kind of place where you instantly feel comfortable and connected.\nSeriously thankful for discovering this gem! If you're looking for a memorable dining experience with fantastic plant-based food and a beautiful ambiance, Somebody People is a must-try in Denver. Highly recommend checking out their Sunday Supper Club if you get the chance! This place is underrated- I am not vegetarian and this by far has exceeded my expectations. Amazing food and the team was really great! We would recommend the Feed Me courses to try a little bit of everything. Had some cocktails which were also great. If you want to celebrate someone or have great time this is the spot!! Hit up Sunday supper it\u2019s an experience!! The staff is so nice and always make sure you are taken care of! Made my visit to Denver even better. You are taking care of and well feed!! Had the best experience at Somebody People for my husband\u2019s birthday! We did their Sunday Supper and it was amazing\u2014such a fun, thoughtfully curated, multi-course vegan meal. The food is very vegetable-forward and borders on fine dining, but still feels warm and approachable. Every dish was flavorful and creative, and the drinks were just as good.\n\nThe vibe was relaxed but elevated, and the service made the night feel special. Highly recommend for a unique plant-based experience, especially for a celebration or date night. We\u2019ll definitely be back! The servers and atmosphere is very cool. Neon lights when you walk in. The food overall was solid. We ordered the Feed Me Menu, a set menu with 4 courses. The focaccia was so soft and fluffy, the melon salad was also very good. Roasted broccoli was lovely. The rigatoni was absolutely the stand out. Fresh made pasta was perfect. The cabbage was a little heavy on the vinegar for our taste. The dessert was lovely. The peach cake is delectable."

    "reviews": "Pub on Pearl has everything you could ask for - pool tables that can be modified into beer pong tables, touchtunes, arcade games, and a PHOTOBOOTH (10/10). Bethany is the most attentive and caring manager. I called last minute on a Friday to ask if I could hang up an engagement sign as a surprise for my friend, and Bethany went above and beyond to make our night amazing (reserved a pool table, offered champagne, let us decorate etc.) The atmosphere at pub on pearl is always so fun and intimate. I prefer this local bar over any bar in Denver!! Went to this neighborhood pub at the intersection of Pearl and Mississippi on a Friday evening around 5:00. Not too crowded then and found a table for three without any wait. Opened a tab and ordered 3 pounds of wings (BBQ, Buffalo) and Cajun cheese fries with some drinks. Wings are big and saucy. Friendly service and easy going atmosphere. Lots of TVs to watch sports, and more seating, video games, and two pool tables in the rear of the restaurant. Plenty of seats inside and outside. Street parking in a residential neighborhood. Go on a Thursday night for cheap wings (with an alcoholic drink order minimum). Not too bad, will return! It\u2019s my hubby\u2019s favorite bar therefore one of mine. The service is always great and vibe is right. If you are looking for a place that\u2019s relaxed, judgement free, and overall a great time you should check it out. The bartender said the kitchen was closed and a group came in after us and they just ordered and received pizza. The drinks were also watered down and she was very rude. Not coming back! We have came here for every Iowa Hawkeye game for the last 3 years and continue to love it. The bartenders and employees are amazing! The food, service and atmosphere are great!"

    "reviews": "Always happy. Service can be slow on game day, but people are always kind and the food is always reliably good. Can't go wrong. Also their BLT is HUGE! And it's rare to find a place that will do just Flats on the chicken wings - this place does. Love it! Great vibe, free darts, inexpensive pool. Matt and Troy are 10/10. Best fish and chips I\u2019ve ever had in Denver. They fly in fresh walleye every Friday. Way better than GB\u2019s or any of the fake Irish pubs in town. Guinness on tap and a great selection of other beers as well. Unpretentious. Smoked wings. Bartender in a Red Fang shirt. Sweet potato fries. Multiple hockey games on at the same time. Wood paneling. Friendly staff. I\u2019d give this place a 6/5 if I could. I arrived just 10 minutes before 11 and was thrilled to discover that the kitchen was still open. Despite the closing time, the staff were incredibly accommodating and allowed me to place an order. The food was truly fabulous!\n\nI opted for the onion soup melt and a BLT, both of which were expertly prepared and utterly delicious. I also added a side of blue cheese salad, which was the perfect complement to my meal. The blue cheese was tangy and rich, with just the right amount of pungency.\n\nI think I\u2019ll definitely be back. Had a great Avs playoff game experience.  Service staff came around at correct times during a busy night with quick drink refills. The smoked wings were still juicy which is great when considering how much fine tuning smoked wings take."

    "reviews": "Food was good, though it took a while to arrive. Waitress, while friendly, never asked if we wanted another beer. The answer would've been Yes, so I guess we saved money by not being asked, nor upsold.\nThere's a semi-shared outdoor patio space with coffee shop next door, single pool table, board games, arcade games and hunting decor as well as old DU sports pics.\nI'll probably be back. Great spot for a game!\n\nI had the BBQ Bacon Burger and was thoroughly impressed.\n\nWe took a big group here for a playoff NFL game. They were open early that day for the game, and happily accommodated us to the best of their ability.\n\nI would encourage looking into reservations on their website for bigger events like playoffs, etc.\n\nThe food was appreciated all around and the beer and food were both priced well for the atmosphere. It's very much a sports bar in all the right ways.\n\nPool table and shuffle board in the back game room were nice additions as well. Honestly, a 10/10 experience for the ncaa natty. Great wings - are they smoked? They were fire. Kinda miss the salad bar and thought it was all you can eat wings. PSA - will be missing that, too. Server was lovely - went above and beyond. Emma is a queen and heated up our chocolate sauce for our ice cream and just overall, had a great time. Green chili was some of the best I've had. Hearty and just slightly spicy, very savory. Only went in for a beer, but looked like it would be a fun place to watch the games! Weird place, back patio was better before they built the room. The bartender with the pink hair made me have a flash back to dive bars in Massachusetts. Thats not a compliment. There was also like 5 people with laptops open at the bar after 5 p.m. You working at the bar or sports betting or something?More of a regulars bar if you know what I mean. The pitchers of beer are also very expensive for that kind of spot."

We love coming here for every reason! Bottles mimosas, the food, the service, and the atmosphere! Never disappointed First time eating here today. We shared the Prime Rib Egg Rolls, the Short Rib Nachos, and the Monte Cristo. Everything was delicious, and the servers were friendly. Will definitely eat here again. We went for a party.  The food was excellent.  Loved the prime rib egg rolls.  The guacamole was like my mom used to make.  I recommend the black cherry margaritas.  The service was also excellent Great spot! We sat on the newly renovated back patio area for a real estate event. Service was very friendly and the atmosphere is quiet away from the rest of the bar. Great menu and surpasses elevated bar food. Well presented and great taste and quality. I got an old fashion to drink and it was served with a square ice cube and orange slice and it was delicious."

    "reviews": "Came here for the oysters and happy hour and was satisfied for sure! Their oysters come with saltine crackers, which I've not had in Colorado. I liked that added touch. I also really loved their clam chowder soup too. So delicious and flavorful! We had their cheesecake too and wow was that tasty. Cozy atmosphere, great happy hour deals, delicious food, and wonderful service! Husband had their fish and chips and their slaw was kinda odd tasting... Maybe needed some more salt? Still delicious. I went with a friend and made a reservation.   I was seated immediately and our server was attentive but not hovering.  We ordered the shrimp ceviche and a couple of drinks to start.  We got them during happy hour so they had a little discount.  The ceviche was wonderful.  We both got the scallops for the entree.  We would have liked more scallops(there were only three).  They were a good size though, and perfectly cooked.  The orzo/kale mixture was good with the scallops as well.  We sat and chatted for a bit after finishing our meal and were not rushed out.  The atmosphere was friendly and social.  It wasn't too hot, or cold.   Their seafood is always amazing and never fishy tasting unlike other places I have been to in Colorado. I normally get the mussels and lobster rolls which are absolutely fantastic as well, but we wanted to try somthing new this time. We will be back again!!! Max Gill & Grill has been a mainstay on my list of favorite Denver restaurants for decades. The food and drinks are always high quality and consistently delicious. Their happy hour is one of the best in town, especially the all-day happy hour on Thursdays. Perfect way to kick off the weekend early. Max's is great for anything from a nice dinner, drinks after work, to hosting special events in their back tiki bar. Highly recommend! Had the most delightful happy hour at Max\u2019s Gill and Grill, the cocktails, oysters, and ceviche were so yummy. Prices are reasonable, super friendly staff, and can\u2019t beat the neighborhood vibe of South Gaylord Street. New favorite happy spot! I was so excited about the Easter buffet that I forgot to take photos! \ud83e\udd23 It was amazing!! It had traditional brunch egg dishes, potatoes breakfast meats, lunchtime fair including Mac & cheese, a prime rib and ham station, shrimp Alfredo, oysters on the half shell, chilled shrimp cocktail, a lovely salmon dish, Mediterranean Mahi Mahi, salads, fruit, and desserts.... $50!!!! No joke, it was the best brunch in Denver AND the most reasonably priced!! Bonus of an absolutely charming Florida Keys feeling vibe! It may be my new hangout! \ud83d\ude0d"

    "reviews": "Big fans of perdida so we had to try this place out. Patio was great. Plenty of umbrellas and or heat. Sever was very attentive. Food and drinks came out pretty quickly. Per my mom, margarita was good but not as good perdida. Pizza and burger were top notch. Would continue to come back with the parents. Would recommend. Great place! The staff is friendly and the food is excellent. Very family friendly environment and dude\u2026some of the best pizza around! For real, the crust and pizza are well balanced; the bottom is well toasted and the sauce has a sweetness that makes it stand out. Pepperoni rolls are also the bomb. The people and food make it stand out for that 5-star rating I live out of state, but come back home to Denver often. This has been one of my favorite places to grab a great salad or a meal. My sister ordered salads tonight through DoorDash. I had the beet salad which I normally love.\n\nUnfortunately, I saw something that was a different color than the lettuce in my salad. It was more of a blue/green and when I pulled it out, it was a sharp piece of what appears to be a wire wrap from something in the kitchen? I\u2019m thankful that it didn\u2019t go down my throat because that wouldn\u2019t have been good at all. I was cautious about finishing it and pretty much lost my appetite. I was concerned about finding more, which I didn\u2019t, but one piece of sharp wire in your salad is enough.\n\nVery disappointing and definitely has changed my view about this restaurant. For the time being unlikely to order again. I don\u2019t know if this was because of the vendor that you order your greens from or a careless kitchen worker. Either way it shouldn\u2019t have happened. \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50 Cozy Atmosphere & Amazing Food!\n\nWe had such a fantastic dinner at Homegrown Tap & Dough! From the moment we walked in, we were impressed by the warm, cozy decor\u2014it has such a great vibe that makes you want to stay and enjoy the night. It does get pretty busy, so I\u2019d definitely recommend calling ahead or making a reservation if possible.\n\nNow, onto the food\u2014absolutely incredible! We tried the \u201cPete-za,\u201d and wow, it was a game-changer. The flavors were spot on! The burgers were juicy and cooked to perfection, and the wine selection paired perfectly with everything. On top of all that, our waiter was wonderful\u2014friendly, attentive, and made our experience even better.\n\nWe\u2019ll definitely be back for another amazing meal. Highly recommend this place to anyone looking for great food and a welcoming atmosphere! Great pizza and awesome ambience. Ease of access to the place was great. A little difficult for parking but the taste was great with a high quality ingredients in the food."

The atmosphere is full of a bunch of kids who think they're too cool . Would not recommend this place to anyone. There's a liquor store right next door. It is a dive bar with a great fried food menu and a decent bunch of beers for watching a game. The mixed drinks are great too. Nice place to play a game of pool before 10:00. Check em out for a low-key great experience. We flew into Denver and wanted to shoot some pool.  Took an Uber and weren't disappointed with the place. Nice tables and great place to just relax and shoot a few games. One of my favorite local spots. The service is fantastic and the karaoke is a blast! I think it's weird that ANYONE under 21 isn't allowed ever. Came in at 2 in the afternoon on a Wed to kill a few minutes and my 8 year old got us kicked out."

    "reviews": "Hands down the best place to eat in Denver!!! Had the most amazing dinner. Portions are huge, so had to take dessert home! Service was outstanding, Luke took care of me and recommended their GREAT selection of house made brews! If you're in Denver (and hungry) GO HERE!!! If you want that Old English Pub charm and all the amazing pub food with a Colorado twist, this is your place. Amazing place for brews as they make their own as well. The Colorado Green chili is the good stuff.\n\nYou can't go wrong with anything on the menu, and the staff was attentive and friendly. FANTASTIC Place! The food is excellent! If you are looking for a dim-lit, cozy place with amazing comfort food- THIS IS IT. I have been a few times and I am absolutely obsessed! Highly recommend their Prime Rib, French dip Sandwich or French Onion Soup- Definitely best in class. Place was phenomenal! Recommended by employee from the Hyatt. Prime rib was outstanding,  and the bartender recommended green Chile topping for my potatoes, with pork!  10 outta 10! I come to denver alot, and will be back.  Great ambiance too I have been here a few times and was surprised I never left a review! Came yesterday as a date night with the hubby and failed to think that it wouldn't be crazy loud due to sporting events being shown. We were sat in a back area full of football fans (which I myself am one) after the broncos game was over and the college game currently underway. The area was pretty loud so I guess maybe next time we won't go on a game day haha. Couldn't hear myself think back there.\n\nWe ordered drinks, an amber ale and martini. (Both yummy) And then ordered our meals. My hubby got a horseradish burger and I got the pulled pork sandwich which all came with fries. Everything was just okay. He said he liked his burger fine and he liked the fries. I just didn't love that my pulled pork sandwich came with the bbq sauce on the side. It should already be on there. The bottom roll was soggy and fell apart maybe two bites in due to the wetness of the coleslaw. So I ate the majority of it with a fork off my plate. I myself wasn't a fan of the fries as well.  Bummer.\n\nService was good though, our gal was nice and all. This visit was just a miss for me compared to the past."

Nice portions. Their food is gives off the \u201chome cooking\u201d vibe! Excellent. Only bad thing is I don\u2019t live in Colorado so I\u2019ll miss this place :( Really good food. Eggs are always fluffy and their Sucuk (flavorful Turkish sausage) is fresh and great on a sandwich. Great for breakfast, and it\u2019s a nice clean atmosphere to read or do homework. Really nice staff that allow you to try things you haven\u2019t yet. Their pastries are better than the other Turkish places nearby too (Sarma is my favorite). Can\u2019t wait to come back, and to tell all of our friends that this spot is a must go! The food is made with love \u2014 flavorful, intentional, and fresh. The baguettes are so soft and the selection is big! Recommend trying a bunch of different things and sharing with a partner or group, because everything is delicious. The food is delicious and the service is awesome. They gave us a bunch of free samples before we ordered and the food was just awesome. The portion sizes are normal, not too big. The people working here are very nice. This place filled up very quickly at lunchtime and the people working here are hustling fast to get everyone's orders out on time. We loved it here and would absolutely come back.\n\nParking is free - there's a lot outside. There is indoor seating, but no outdoor seating right now (February). Amazing breakfast, cafe and Turkish food. The staff was helpful in advising what to order and the service was great and quick. Prices are reasonable. Definitely would come again if I am in town."

    "reviews": "The flavors of the vermicelli and Vietnamese sandwiches are spot on. Delicious. The food was quickly made. The reason for the 4 star is because the beef was fatty and very difficult to chew in both dishes. Best pho in Denver & the vermicelli bowls are amazing. Friendly service too! Good small Pho restaurant. Very large menu selection but I always get the noodle soup. Their large is LARGE and it is only $1 more then the medium and it is enough for two meals. The boba smoothies are too sweet for me.\n\nService is very fast. The food is also very consistent. I had my lunch there last Friday. I ordered the beef pho noodle. The beef served in the pho had two colors. One is in dark color and the other is much lighter. I was a little suspicious about the beef but I still ate the pho. Worst decision I have ever made. My stomach started getting hurt badly from later afternoon. I literally lived on the toilet for several hours.\nI\u2019m probably not going back there again. Amazing pho and wonderful staff in humble digs. Perfection."

You can actually eat here and not feel like you have to take out a loan to pay the bill like most other restaurants. Very good Indian food. The aroma of spices greets you as you enter. The lamb curry was delicious with rice. The Naan bread came out hot and tasty and the Chai was good. The menu has a lot of good sounding choices. Most things can be ordered with one of five spice levels. The first time you visit, you might want to order one level lower than you think you want and move up on later visits if you want more heat.\n\nAlthough lunch is normally buffet style, today they did table service probably because they couldn't predict how busy it would be with the snow. The service was friendly and efficient. The space is attractive with both booths and tables. They do have high chairs, but do not have Wi-Fi.\n\nAmple parking is provided. Our favorite Indian restaurant!   We started coming here in 2021 and have loved every dish.  We drive across town about once a month just to eat here, it\u2019s that good! It was my first time ordering from Taste of India and I\u2019m so glad I did! My ordering experience was SO easy through the website. When I went to pick it up, it was hot and ready. The people who greeted me were so kind and it smelled so good in there! My tikka masala was incredible, samosas were delicious, and naan was phenomenal! Portions are large and I\u2019m so excited that I have left overs. Highly recommend coming here. Really looking forward to the next time I come and can\u2019t wait to try something new! Very very tasty! I ordered the Vegetable Biryani and the Paneer Pakora. The portions are very large! So I\u2019ll be happy to have leftovers for a few days. I got \u201cmild\u201d spiciness and it was pretty hot for me. But I do love spicy food so it was alright ! The delivery took about 20 min from the time of leaving the restaurant and the food packaging kept everything fresh and hot. I\u2019ll definitely be ordering from here again!"

A must visit restaurant, can\u2019t wait to return. The state of desperation I was in to find a brand new pizza left me deep in myself hoping to be awoken. I was looking for a place that was type of soul pleaser. Pizza cooked to perfection 10/10 would recommend. Definitely the best middle eastern cuisine spot in the state, not only does the food taste heavenly but the customer service is top notch, all the employees and the owner are such kindhearted people and they seem to truly care about their customers and their feedback. 100/10 this is my new go to spot! Haven\u2019t tried this place in the neighborhood yet. We ended up here on accident.  A happy accident it was!  This place has terrific food and service! The gyro calzone!? \ud83e\udd2f Loved it. This place is a scam. I ordered a 14\u201d & they gave me a 12\u201d. Then they insisted it was 14\u201d. Then I measured it in front of them. Then suddenly it\u2019s a 14\u201d pan, not a 14\u201d pizza. They also don\u2019t tell you about the $0.95 \u201csupport local\u201d fee until you\u2019ve already paid it\n\nAbsolute garbage company."

Our food was ready fast, and it was alright to kill hunger for a while. The biggie bag fries and nuggets are small, as well as the burger but it was pretty decent for the price as well. Wow clearly I should\u2019ve read the reviews before visiting this location! I ordered pick up here yesterday via mobile app and am completely dissatisfied. I received a sugar cookie instead of chocolate like I ordered. Did not receive a triple berry frosty but instead received a mango lemonade for the \u201cinconvenience\u201d. And I also ordered a cheeseburger last minute that I would\u2019ve assumed would be fresh/hot since I asked at the window. It was not it was extremely cold so much so the cheese hadn\u2019t even melted at all. I ate sleep for dinner thanks a lot Wendy\u2019s \ud83d\ude35\u200d\ud83d\udcab\ud83d\udc94 Got chili and they asked if I wanted cheese and onion. I said yes. The gave me full slices of onions inside the chili. Not sure how they thought this was cool This is the best Wendy's location in the city. The manager by the name of Alexandra is awesome; she is extremely friendly and always seems to be smiling when I come in. The food was really fresh and really good. Highly recommend the Cobb salads, chili, and of course the classic cheeseburgers are always delicious. Great job to the whole staff, and especially to the manager Alexandra. Every single time I come to this location the employees have a shitty attitude. I clearly asked for a hi c orange I got a strawberry Fanta . I asked if she could give me a hi c orange . She had the nerve to roll her eyes then they are quick you give you the wrong order and push you off . I do not recommend this place"

    "reviews": "I've never had this style of gyros before. The tastes were. Great blend of savory and sweet. Definitely a skilled chef in the kitchen. I did not like that the meat was cut in bite size pieces. It allowed it fall out of the gyro. I now know I prefer shaved meat. The decor of the restaurant was beautiful, it's too bad the place was not busier, it is a great place. Clean, friendly and good food. Good middle Eastern restaurant in a small strip mall. The lamb dishes are great. The lamb kebabs were a lot of food for lunch. The lamb was cooked to perfection and paired well with the sauce. The rice and vegetables were very good. I had planned to go with Flan for dessert but was full by then.\n\nService is good - fast and friendly. The space is nicely decorated and comfortable. The music is low level and pleasant.\n\nThe parking lot is small and can fill at peak times. Our server was super nice. It's definitely worth a try. Good Moroccan food.  It's a bit milder in flavor. Cafe Paprika was absolutely amazing. We were in Aurora, CO, for a conference and wanted to try something new.  We had a very large group and called ahead and talked with Omer, who was phenomenal during our meal!  We asked for recommendations on what to eat, and he suggested a variety of different items - all of which were outstanding. Our group's favorites were the Bastilla, the Ziti Chicken, the Moroccan Mint Tea, and the Kabobs (we got multiple different types).  It was a cozy little place and provided a warm, welcoming atmosphere. One of the best meals that I have had! Stopped in for a late lunch and tried the kabob sampler. The standout, against my expectations,were the heavily spiced veggies and mushrooms. I don't normally like sliced mushrooms, but I inhaled these ones.\n\nI'll have to come back and try the one of the Moroccan dishes on the dinner menu. Apparently this place has been open for the last 31 years, so I might be a little late to the party."

This menu was a little new to us not ever have been to a German food restaurant. Our server Jessica answered all our questions, suggested delicious items/drinks that we probably would have not chosen. Jessica was super friendly and nice and sets the bar high for how servers should treat their customers. The whole staff we encountered was very friendly. We WILL be going back here many more times! In the picture I enjoyed warm house made potato salad, 1 smoked brat, 1 Reuben brat and plenty of their house made sauerkraut - SO DELICIOUS! We also enjoyed some delicious appetizers as well. 10 out 10 experience for us eating dinner here. Food was very enjoyable and great flavor. I ordered the pork schnitzel with spatzel and potatoes. App was obligatry pretzel with a side of beer cheese/ mustard. Cool decor inside and music fun. There appears to be a gift store of some sort but is closed on Mon/ Tues. I can't find German food easy in MA/ NH so this was a great find. I stopped in for my birthday their Schnitzel and was super happy with the whole experience. The breaded and fried cutlet was cooked to perfection, perfectly balanced between crispy exterior and juicy interior. My server was incredibly attentive, refilling my drink and checking in often without making me feel like I was being hovered over. They had a smaller price tag than I expected for such a big portion of food, which was a really nice surprise. The cozy atmosphere just added to my afternoon, it felt like a warm and welcoming spot to grab a meal. Last night we tried the bratwurst, surprisingly good and they were. The overall ambiance was fantastic, a good mix of old and new. The check was right, not too heavy. Friendly staff. It wasn't too noisy or too quiet. Never felt rushed, we could enjoy our time. We'll certainly be back. We found this place near our Air BnB. The food was excellent, the service was fantastic. When we arrived there was a wonderful man playing the accordion and it was enjoyable. Soon after a band started playing and we had the best time singing and dancing with the band."

    "reviews": "Great place. The food drinks are fairly priced and poured genoursouly. The food was also fantastic they had a new business take over the kitchen. Borderless Food Truck.\n\nYou gotta try this place. Had the catfish poboy and the monster burger.\n\nAlso ask the bar tenders about the berry lemonade. It went well with whisky. Went Sunday night they held a poetry slam. Very entertaining.  Lots of talent. Then we ordered some catfish nuggets & fries. I've had cat fish a trillion times and I'm telling you it was some got dang good fish ... whoever cooking at the Oasis bar & and grill, thank you. That was a good meal Great local community bar. They have good food.  And the crowd is mixed and friendly. I really enjoy that they have things for every night. Sometimes there's karaoke, other times there's a DJ, sometimes you're watching the game or there might be a comedy night. And if you get lucky there might be a pajammy jam.\n\nAlways good food, Great company and good music Y\u2019all will always be trash unless y\u2019all get Mr Key the chef back.  y\u2019all wings went from the best in the city to blend and disgusting. I bought them and threw them away. Sorry do better The food was great, The service was okay, but the servers were not very friendly the night we attended. It could have been because it was Halloween night and it was very crowded, The crowd was a very younger crowd 25-40. The DJ was fire and was playing some great music. I might try again on a less busier night to see if other services are better then."

    "reviews": "We placed an order after my bf got off work through uber. I understand it was close to closing time, so we expected soggy fries and what not.. Typical fast food behavior\u2026 what we did not expect was containers that had not been properly closed, just thrown into the bag. Leaky, messy, cold nuggets almost soaking through the bag. The fries, dumped upside down into the bag spilling to the bottom. It was not sitting there long as we got our food within 15ish minutes after placing our order. We did not receive a frosty and instead we were given\u2026 lemonade??? Maybe?, no ice and not even completely filled. Our other drinks, same. To say we were disappointed is an understatement. Have the days you deserve \u270c\ufe0f I'm giving this a 5 star rating just for Christian (running the drive through the morning of 4/3). Give this man a RAISE for being so polite and overall welcoming. That's the kind of gentleman that makes me wanna come back! Way to go Christian! Fries taste like cardboard at best. The employees has terrible attitude.  If you hate your job then leave. And my fries weren't all the way cooked I did not just pay $30 for some burgers that were bright pink, sadly didn't realize till it was basically too late. I was also missing items.  Everything was just thrown around in the bag and no one answers the phone number listed Unfortunately there has been three times in a row where our orders are just whatever the staff feels like throwing into bags at random. Who is slacking off refilling the chocolate frosty mixture?? How have you been unable to fulfill one of your most popular menu items three times in a row over two months? As a former fast food kitchen manager i can tell you the answer is absolutely laziness and unwillingness to do their work from staff, no one will tell you the chocolate frosty isn't in stocks just give you whatever the heck they feel like handing out the window. Every food item is either stale from sitting out for so long or undercooked to the point of being dangerous. Can't imagine they'll last much longer and I dread to see what their grade will be after their next health inspection. Save yourself money and your stomach the suffering, go somewhere else."

    "reviews": "Generally fine. Cinnamon rolls are very dry I recommend skipping those.\nEric, actually I get quite a few responses from owners. I did have frosting on the cinnamon but it was still hard to get through. The cinnamon roll was had on 4/14/25. I tried a pecan roll today (4/27/25) it was a little better but still needs some work. I would like to give more stars but have to face the facts that after years of coming here the results are inconsistent. Lately service has been faster so you have that going for you. Couple of photos added hope owner can see.. working around food can\u2019t have hair flying around. Love the coffee. I just started going here a couple months ago and honestly I'm surprised this place has negative reviews. Every time I go I'm greeted with friendly smiles and I've never had a problem with my coffee or food (which by the way, if you haven't tried the pastries they are delicious). Love the atmosphere here, it makes a great place to work for a little while of chat with friends and I absolutely love browsing through the spices and greeting cards. This is a unique opportunity to support a local small business and really enjoy a great cup of coffee and pastry. The gift shop is extensive with all kinds of cute coffee mugs which I purchased a couple for gifts. Also, I\u2019ve brought selection of coffee beans to purchase and take home. Also a unique offering of herbs and spices two pots and coffee machines. Such a cute shop! I have been in here a couple times to pick up coffee beans from the Goodie Bag app, I love that they partner with them to reduce food waste. We decided to get some drinks and the coffee was very tasty. They make a very dry cappuccino though, pretty much bone dry, so keep that in mind if you prefer a wetter cappuccino. Overall a great cozy shop!"

    "reviews": "We had received a gift card from our friends who raved about this place. I can say- they exceeded expectations! Not only was the steak cooked to perfection and paired with the best seasoned baked potato, but the service was outstanding! Izzy at the hostess stand upgraded us to a booth once she had a cancellation (we didn\u2019t have reservations). She was so sweet and considerate! Our waitress Lauren was also exceptional as she asked right before happy hour ended if we would like another round. Thank you for helping us save a buck, because we are happy to add what we saved to the tip! Overall great experience! We came here for date night and it was fantastic! We got the mussels, which were cooked perfectly and delicious. The steak and the French pork chop. Also cooked perfectly and so tasty! We got a few cocktails and a bottle of wine too and our bill was way lower than anticipated. Our server Alex (I think that\u2019s his name, younger man with dark curly hair) was also great! I highly suggest coming here. Sucks to see a good steakhouse move into Highlands Ranch right as I\u2019m leaving but it\u2019s a nice little spot. They cleaned it up and decorated it nicely. Good looking menu at reasonable prices. I had the pork chop. Very tender and nice char. The King Crab Dip is the star of the show. The NY strip with the bleu cheese butter and sauteed mushrooms was really delicious and cooked to perfection.\n\nThe calamari was just average and the lemon artichoke orzo was way too lemony. Just overpowering. But the worst part was they have the absolute smallest weakest wine pour of any steakhouse I've ever been to. You can see the picture of it here. Maybe got 3 or 4 sips tops for a $16 glass of wine. Like step it up and give a normal pour. That's just flat out bad for business. The Old Fashion was okay but again really small.\n\nOur server Morgan was stellar. A friend and mine went here for the first time and I gotta say wow! What an amazing experience with great food. Our server/ bartender Savannah was so attentive and so sweet even with a full bar! It was honestly very impressive we sat so fast with no reservations (I feel like we just got lucky on that one). The place was hopping for Sunday night and the great service and our food came out perfect, I feel that was a feat in its own what a great team you have there and we will definitely be back!"

    "reviews": "I have always been a big fan of BWW's and I had been wanting to try their burgers. When I say I was disappointed, it's an understatement. My husband had ordered a mushroom Swiss burger, but they were out of ingredients (okay, fine), I ordered a patty melt with tots and there was half of a single slice of bacon in the entire sandwich and I got potato wedges instead of my tots. Again, fine. But the 3 of us became so sick within 2 hours of eating the food and have spent this next day so sick from upset stomachs. I definitely won't be so quick to head to BWW's but just beware of the hamburgers maybe. The $20 all you can eat wings definitely a good price just make sure you don't eat before going so you can actually get your money's worth the waitress that we had was very good wish I could remember her name would definitely be going back just because of the waiter The food was pretty good. We got 30 wings, 20 of which being boneless and 10 being traditional. Along with baskets of fries.\n\nMy friend got a burger, and he didn't like it since it was raw and burnt. We asked the manager about this and she apologized and gave us a free dessert, she was kind and understanding.\n\nI have been going here for a while, but today the one time they do screw something up, they fix it with ease, which very much warrants these 5 stars. As a sports fan love the energy of bdubs.  Wait staff is great but can get overbusy.  They are always professional but approachable and fun.  Love the people here.  Wings can be a little inconsistent as far as size and bread to chicken ratio but flavor is always delicious. This place is absolutely disgusting. We couldn\u2019t eat one thing of our food. We\u2019ve been coming here for years and this is our last. The macaroni and cheese was so old and dry that it was plastic. All the wings had burnt feathers. These corporate places do not care about its customer base. I highly recommend not eating here. You\u2019re way better off supporting local small businesses where the attention to detail and customer service is paramount. I mean, just look at all the negative reviews. They ain\u2019t lying. YUCK!!! Plus, even if you fill out their ridiculous form on their website, do they actually care? NOPE! Corporate greed at its best."

    "reviews": "We went here for a casual dinner on a Sunday night, it was not super busy and we were able to get sat at the bar right away. The French onion soup was delicious and not too salty. The Brussels sprouts were amazing and not too brussely. We didn\u2019t have any cocktails but the drink menu looked very good. Came on a Saturday afternoon not overly busy, sat on the outside patio. Table we got was slanted from the brick floor so that sucked. Wont let em sit us there again. Food was good had the poke nachos they were delicious! Nice and fresh, chips were nice and thin and the tuna was fresh. Also had the chicken burger it was ok they charge you for everything on it??? So if you order just the chicken burger I would imagine it\u2019s just a slab of chicken on the bun w a side of tomato and lettuce. $1.50 for cheese, 1.50 for mushrooms, $1.50 for ranch. That\u2019s lame in my opinion. My friend had the Prime rib sandwich he said it was good, it didn\u2019t have any onions or mushrooms included on it, just a hoagie with meet in it. Waitress seemed in a hurry not to friendly. Also didn\u2019t ask if we needed anything later on, we stopped her and asked for more water. A very lively place to come with friends of family. Other than the prices for the steak options, the cost for everything else was reasonable. It can be hard to find parking. Our server was very nice, the food came out fast and it tasted great, it was a clean environment, and we all had a great time. Excellent menu choices for both food and drinks. The salads are great and you can add some protein to mix and match. Anything with the short ribs is delightful too. The breakfast is very tasty as well. Nice bright restaurant and a great patio facing the Belmar plaza. I heard they had a good burger, so I stopped by to give them a review on my  food blog.  The kitchen made a couple mistakes with my order, but our waiter James was SUPER pleasant, accommodating & went above and beyond to correct the errors.  Awesome job James!!!"

    "reviews": "Wasn't super busy. But it took the server almost 10 minutes to come greet us once we had been seated.  Fortunately, we ordered everything all at once since we had ample time to look over the menu.  I had the half chicken. It was ok. a little over cooked as it was dry. The veggies and mashed potatoes were solid, tho. we also had an app. The deviled eggs- they were very salty, but the presentation looked nice. The best item I had was my Old fashioned and that was superb \ud83d\udc4c The server was really nice so even tho it took them a while to greet us once we were sat , she was so pleasant it didn't effect her tip. OVERALL pretty mid as far as service and food go. Nice staff and decent drinks pics below. \u2b07\ufe0f The space is huge \u2014 plenty of seating and bar space. Beer was fresh. A flight is 5 tasters for $15, a total steal. Food was great. We loved the black bean dip, and the turkey burger is indeed homemade. Steak frites well cooked. Can\u2019t wait to come back! The food here is amazing, I was very surprised. Most breweries will have a decent bite to eat while drinking some craft brews but this place goes above and beyond. The service was excellent as well. Our waitress, Jordan was phenomenal. We had a graduation party of 16 and she was very prompt in making sure everyone was served quickly.\nEveryone's food was great and we can't thank you guys enough for all your hard work in providing us with excellent customer service.\nI would highly recommend them to anyone looking for great food, but just as important, great customer service.\nI enclosed a picture of my food called \"Da Bomb!\" And it was just that......DA BOMB! Delicious cocktails and fun food choices all served by our great hostess, Raylyn!\n\nWe were staying next door, so no issues with parking, however, it doesn't seem like it would be an issue. All walks of life in the neighborhood, so it made our experience very memorable. Seating was available outside, but the weather kept us indoors. Lots of screens to display every sport. Fun stop after a long day."

    "reviews": "One long time manager/or/owner is consistently unhappy and stressed.. and I'll explain more after acknowledging... the dining room atmosphere is almost always clean, it has lots of spaces for us to enjoy our meal together with comfort, TV's, fireplace, back glass patio area.  We enjoy a night out at this location at least once a week, and I have come to this location for over 22 years.  Wendy's has family friendly meal deal prices, especially using the app to make mobile orders earning rewards and daily offers.. you can use both a reward and an offer together in one order on the Wendy's app! It often saves our family a good deal.  The food is good quality and they get special orders right most of the time (like no bun or no sauces.. etc).. the BIG BUT though that drags the whole experience down is ONE of the managers.. (he has been there for years and usually in a grump mood).. the last two times IN A ROW we have decided to eat in the dining room, he was complaining to others in great detail about how he HATES doing mobile orders, as a matter of fact the last time I was waiting at a table for my order, I heard him telling another employee HE HATES doing mobile orders WITH A PASSION, going on and on about it!!   I was like.. wait a minute, I excused the comment the first day he was saying that, we have bad days, work is stressful.. I get it, but the second time I was there and heard him complaining again (on a different day) where everyone can hear him kind of triggered me.. the reason being that you get all the rewards and discounts by doing a mobile order, daily offers are sent to me popping up on my phone.. I don't get those perks going up to the counter and directly ordering from him or directly through the drive-thru, like it seems he would prefer.  The mobile orders are where they give you those perks!  That second time I actually said something to him.. I told him that this is the second time in a row that I've been there that I've heard him complaining out loud where about how he hates doing mobile orders with a passion.  I told him that is his job!  He responded with \"they're just really hard\".. well then Mr. Manager, tell them to stop offering all the perks and rewards on the app then, or maybe have someone else in charge of the mobile orders, or maybe look into doing something easier.  This has made my family often divert to a different location when we know he is working, even though we really like this one better.  His attitude is always growly, and he doesn't like you standing up there waiting for your order at the counter.  He does make sure that the orders come out correctly, and I guess that's what matters most.  I have to say though.. when there is someone else running the front, there have been some pretty cool people behind that counter! Went this morning before work, bought two breakfast baconators and they tasted off. Turns out both had sausages that were burnt black. Called over 10 times, no answer.. Complete BS Recently moved to the area. I love Wendy's. I love the mobile app. I do not love that this specific location hasn't just failed to, but seems to refuse to make orders as they're placed. This time they still didn't get the order right, but at least I got all of my items. Not before being chased down to be given a burger that otherwise would have been forgotten. I've got the ticket attached to my burger showing how it was ordered, and I'd post a picture if allowed to show the ticket vs the burger I was given. Remove customizable options if they're only to be ignored. I work next door and get Wendy\u2019s for lunch often. It\u2019s always fast and quick, the staff is always nice and friendly. Even if there is a long wait for the drive thru, I only have to wait about 5 minutes, then I get my food. It\u2019s always quick and nice going in. I am so disgusted. I ordered a spicy chicken, not only did they get it wrong but the chicken is RAW"

    "reviews": "I had such a wonderful solo dinner tonight at the Olive Garden on W. Alameda Ave in Lakewood, CO. It had been over a year since I\u2019d been able to enjoy one of my favorite meals\u2014my fianc\u00e9 isn\u2019t a pasta lover, and I haven\u2019t been able to convince him to go since we started dating on May 26, 2024. So tonight, I decided to treat myself after work, and it felt like a small, personal celebration.\n\nI ordered the Chicken Parmigiana with salad, calamari to start, and a watermelon sangria\u2014and everything was absolutely delicious. But what truly made the evening so memorable was the kindness and warmth of Angelica, my server. She was attentive, thoughtful, and genuinely kind. We chatted for a bit, and her sweet demeanor made me feel right at home. It wasn\u2019t just dinner\u2014it was a moment of peace, connection, and joy in the middle of a busy week.\n\nThank you, Angelica, and thank you Olive Garden, for turning an ordinary night into something special. I left with a full heart and a grateful spirit. I won\u2019t wait another year before I come back. It was an absolutely great place to eat. I hadn't been in a really long time and it hit the spot. Everything was delicious and the service was amazing. We used Olive Garden in Belmar Lakewood Colorado to cater our lunch today after the memorial service for my mother-in-law and Brenda was as always such a blessing taking care of everything in getting the food ordered and delivered and everything went without a hitch!!!! They had the food delivered as scheduled and got everything set up. The food was awesome and we even had to get more which took less than 20 minutes to arrive!!!! We actually used this restaurant 3 years ago for the food after my father-in-law service and Brenda knocked it out of the park then also!!!!? Would definitely recommend them for your catering needs and for yummy food !!! Food is good quality here compared to other Olive Gardens. My family and I live in Thornton but go out of our way to come here not just for the quality but the customer service. We have been fortunate to have Ali as our server twice. She\u2019s very personable and efficient. We never have to worry about refills and she doesn\u2019t make us feel like we are needy. My son has autism and doesn\u2019t usually like to try new things. But she always manages to get him to try new things(lucky for us too! )- yummy! thank you for the exceptional service, Ali! Had the absolute pleasure of dining in at this Olive Garden location tonight (Labor Day 2024). We specifically chose this location due to all of the positive reviews and can confirm\u2014wonderful experience all around.\nWe came for the never ending pasta bowl and also shared a pitcher of the watermelon sangria (would recommend). Both our server and the female manager were so friendly, hospitable, and checked on us frequently. Both myself and my partner work in the service industry and have to say: damn, y\u2019all are good.\nEverything came out hot, fresh, and fast. Our favorites were the rigatoni with creamy mushroom sauce and Italian sausage. The five cheese marinara was also on point. Breadsticks were abundant and delicious as always, plus perfect paired with the zuppa toscana and chicken gnocchi soups.\nThank you again to the staff for the excellent food and service!\n(To anyone else reading this review, tip your servers appropriately if you get the never ending option. Our total bill was $68 and we left $30. Ya girl got like four refills.)"

    "reviews": "I decided to start my meal with an order of onion rings as an appetizer, followed by the shrimp tandoori as my main dish, which was served with a generous portion of cheese naan bread and rice. The overall pricing was quite reasonable, especially considering the quantity and quality of the food that was provided. Each dish appeared thoughtfully prepared and well-portioned, offering good value for the money. In terms of taste, everything I tried was flavorful and satisfying, and this level of quality seemed consistent across all the dishes offered by the restaurant. I used to go here every couple weeks. Best Indian restaurant in Denver area hands down. Medium chicken Tikka masala is wonderful and never fails to impress me. If you like hot, go for the vindaloo, it's an experience like no other. Garlic naan is perfect, I would avoid the cherry naan if you don't like coconut.  Always get a mango lassi to kill the heat or for a nice summer treat (with some Captain Morgan if you're feeling it!!)\n\nI think I've tried almost everything in the menu, and the one miss I had was a deep fried chicken. Not my thing as the chicken seems to come out dry, though I'm sure there are some of there that love it too. Little India in Belmar was our favorite Indian restaurant when we lived in Lakewood, and it still is now that we moved up north. The whole family of five loves it. The food is exceptional, the service perfect. Whatever we have ordered, it tasted heavenly. We have never been disappointed by anything over the years. I forgot taking a photo before much was eaten - the formidable food set other priorities.\nIf somebody expects that the waiter asks every three minutes if everything is alright, he or she might be disappointed. At out last visit, it happened only once, I think. This was very enjoyable as the constant intrusions during our meal we would find annoying. Service was there when we needed it. The vegetable samosas were decent: crispy crust, flavorful potato filling, and plenty of chutney and tamarind sauces. The aloo gobi lacked in flavor, and the rice was not seasoned enough. The garlic naan was floppy and they just throw jarred crushed garlic onto the top -- not fresh garlic and not incorporated. Also the naan was not buttery.\n\nThe restaurant was deserted on a Thursday at 6:30 p.m., and I thought that would mean we would get exceptional service because there are fewer tables to satisfy. My assumption was wrong, though our server *was* adequate. He was friendly and engaging, but he was absent for about 5 minutes when we were trying to leave.\n\nThe only other people in the restaurant were noisy and disruptive, which was unfortunate.\n\nThe interior is dark, clean, and modern. I don't like giving negative reviews. The atmosphere was great. The staff were great.\nThe issue I had was 30 minutes after the meal. I was watching a movie next door when I needed to use the restroom. When I got up, my stomach was hurting really bad, and I just made it to the restroom to have massive diarrhea. I was messed up for three days.\nWill I come back ? No way\nWill I recommend it?"

The dim sum is fresh and tastes good and there\u2019s usually little wait since the seating area and parking are both spacious. Obviously not as many dishes as in SF or NYC spots, but good for Denver. The same can be said for the menu dishes. Solid meals and an our go to for traditional Cantonese food. One of the best dim sum places in Colorado, delicious food, and kind service. I love the fact they didn\u2019t rush us like other places and we get to enjoy our meal \ud83d\ude04 Great place with cart service before 3 pm and delicious food! They give you free hot tea when you sit down and my water was never empty. Very friendly waitress. The food was great and didn't cost as much as we were afraid of! I recommend their fried rice and pork dumplings. Such a great dim sum option, complete with fresh grilled dumplings and traditional cart service. There is no long wait like at Star Kitchen and the food is always fresh & delicious. Ah I always crave a good Cantonese Style dinner and this meal was delicious!\n\nWe ordered all our favorite go to dishes: Ginger Scallion Crab, Green Beans with Pork, Roast Duck, Cantonese Style Chow Mein, Shrimp with Lobster Sauce, and Potstickers!\n\nI enjoyed the Green Beans dish. I was so excited to see chung choy in it, which added to the flavor profile. The combination Chow Mein was perfectly crispy with plentiful amounts of tender meat and veggies. Ginger Scallion Crab and Shrimp with Lobster sauce was what we expected and executed well.\n\nSome of the end pieces of duck were a bit salty but overall was very good. I\u2019d love to try the Peking Duck next time with the buns and the crispy roast pork.\n\nI felt the cost of the food was very reasonable with the amount of food given.\n\nI love the fact that you can order dim sum at any time. But makes it hard to choose what to order because everything sounds good.\n\nThe servers were so nice and had very fun personalities, always with a smile on their faces. They made our meal really enjoyable and did a fairly good job keeping our water cups filled.\n\nThe restaurant was spacious and appeared tidy. We went there on a Saturday night and there were people  setting up for likely a wedding event. I\u2019m sure Empress is a place where many Asians have their reception meals and events.\n\nThe neighborhood is a bit sketchy and was happy to see that they had their own parking lot.\n\nWe were only visiting, but we\u2019ll definitely be back to try more items in the future and would recommend others to give it a try!"

    "reviews": "Great Biscuits is a must-visit destination for biscuit enthusiasts. Our recent visit to the neighborhood left us thoroughly impressed. The tomahawk biscuit was exceptional, while the Cubano perfectly catered to my preference for a breakfast without eggs. For my next visit, I intend to indulge in the sausage and biscuits. The delectable appearance of the biscuits, coupled with their Southern origin and my longing for sausage and biscuits, made this a delightful experience. The exceptional service and inviting atmosphere further enhanced our overall enjoyment. I highly recommend giving Great Biscuits a try. Our waiter Samuel was great! He recommended the combo sausage and mushroom gravy with our Franklin and it was delicious. Couldn\u2019t wait to take a good photo because the biscuits are so good. We also love the spicy Bloody Mary with bacon and it comes with home made pickles! We had an incredible dining experience at Atomic Cowboy, thanks to the amazing service from Noah! He was attentive, friendly, and made the best recommendation\u2014the Lola with the Biscuit French Toast. Let me tell you, it was a game-changer! The Biscuit French Toast was perfectly fluffy and had the right balance of sweet and savory. We also ordered the Franklin with Mushroom Gravy, which was rich, comforting, and downright superb. Both dishes were absolutely memorable and showcased the creativity and quality of the menu.\n\nThe atmosphere was vibrant, and the service was top-notch. Noah truly went above and beyond to make sure we had a fantastic time. I\u2019ll definitely be back and will be asking for his recommendations again. Highly recommend! Atomic Cowboy was a great place to eat. We ordered justthe pizza and from what i remember it was an amazing new york style with great crunch. Sadly writing this review a few days after the fact, but I can remember it was great pizza, and I would come again! Swung by this Atomic Cowboy location while waiting to do a distillery tour nearby. The atmosphere inside was welcoming and fun, and the service throughout was congenial. We didn't make it in time to try any breakfast items. The burger and pizza we had though was decent. Would come back again to try breakfast."

    "reviews": "First and foremost, the bartenders here are great. Sam and Orin I have gotten to know well and are fantastic. Additionally, the open mic on Monday\u2019s at 8pm is great! The food is fantastic and the environment is great for a hang and for watching sports. Out of all the bars on Broadway, I can\u2019t recommend this one enough! I rented the Limerick room for a birthday party and the whole team was fantastic start to finish. I worked with Alan, the owner, to schedule and organize the event. He was super helpful, informative, and flexible. The night of the event, Ian was our bartender and he was amazing even when working with a crowd of heavy drinkers. The appetizers were incredible and the space was perfect for what we needed. I couldn\u2019t recommend this place enough for an event space in Denver! I went here for bottomless mimosas, and the service was great. The food was good, and the rooftop was really nice. It's okay, but there are better places around I think. I ordered the sampler and it was okay, the wings were dry. Best thing was the chicken tenders. Wife ordered Fish & Chips and had no complaints. It's not bad, but not really good. I'd recommend checking out a different Pub if you want a more authentic experience. Service is also slow, but they're nice so it evens out. The Irish Rover is a lively pub with a great atmosphere!  The staff were friendly and the service was generally quick.  I enjoyed the Guinness, which was perfectly poured, and the fish and chips were a decent portion size.  However, the music was a little too loud at times, making conversation difficult.  Overall, a fun place for a drink and some casual pub fare, but maybe not ideal for a quiet evening.  Would recommend!"

    "reviews": "Came here with a good friend, love the look of the place and the food is outstanding.\n\nIt serves Czech food, and it is super delicious. I don't even live in the area, but I'm still going to go back.\n\nI believe at some point the place turns into more of a bar, so be sure to get there a bit earlier. Went here for lunch. It wasn't very busy but it is a sports bar so this would be a great place to watch a game. They also have pool tables. The food was delicious. The service was great. There is a parking lot in the back, but it has very limited space. Decent amount of seating inside, and there is an area out back for smokers with seating. Awesome Czech Dive Bar with awesome authentic Czech food and beers!!! Awesome environment for games (huge hockey bar) and a few of pools tables. Great spot for some social drinking and dining! Nice bar and grill on Broadway Street in Denver.  Stopped by late on Friday night and wasn't disappointed.  Great bartenders!  This is a Czech themed hockey bar and grill (good \ud83d\udc4d food) with a large billiards room in the back.  They have live music on some nights.  Hockey jerseys line the ceiling from all teams...\nLots of activity and great music piped in, as well as a pretty good selection of tasty beers.  Only reason I gave this 4 stars and not 5 is because there is only 1 bathroom... I would go back for sure \ud83d\ude01.\n\nUPDATE -- I mistakenly missed the two restrooms in the hallway, as pointed out by the Manager.  My apologies \ud83d\ude10.  DEFINITELY czech this place out! (See what I did there?  LOL \ud83d\ude02).  I'll be sure to go back again (and probably have to find one of those other two bathrooms \ud83e\udd2a).  BTW - the first bathroom in the main room was VERY clean.  Thanks \ud83d\udc4d Played pool there for leagues. Staff was absolutely amazing! Very friendly and prompt to serve. Didn\u2019t eat and there was a lot going on the night I was there. Seemed like a fun bar"

    "reviews": "Classic dive bar with great ambience and people. You could get come here and lose track of time for the rest of the day, which is great.\n\nThe food is nothing special. Sub-standard bar food even. The burger reminded me something you could make at home, the fries are frozen etc.\n\nBut you don't come here for the food. You come here to watch a game and drink away your sorrows. If you want to watch a lions game here you better get there an hour plus early before the game starts. The burgers are really good! The friendliest dive in Denver. The bartenders are top class. The cooks take pride in their food, which is delicious. Candlelight Tavern was a fun place to stop for a few brews. Prices were good for Denver and overall I thought the beer selection was good for a dive bar. Didn\u2019t try food but will next time.\nBartender was also very nice and welcoming. Will be back.\nAnd unlike most dive bars, they had a bathroom mirror in the men\u2019s room so you could snap a quick selfie for the \u2018gram No frill, no thrills, little hole in the wall bar serving a decent burger and fries. Had the jalapeno cream cheese burger. It was good. Would like to come back and try a regular cheeseburger"

    "reviews": "Very welcoming atmosphere, but what so you expect from a bunch of dead heads.\n\nWings were cooked perfectly and sauces\nwere very tasty. Can tell that everything is made fresh.\n\nLady had chicken tenders and they were crispy perfection.\n\nTry the chili cheese fries, if not heap some salt and vinegar on a plate of fries and enjoy. Jamaican jerk was the worst possible flavor. I rarely find myself spitting out food, because of dislike. I couldn\u2019t even manage swallowing it. Medium buffalo was alright. Nothing medium about it but there was a buffalo flavor to it. The wings were small and puny. Definitely not worth $18.69 for 12 wings that barely measured up to my pinky. Also paid $7 for a cup of taco bell ground beef chili with two beans. Probably the worst take out experience I have ever had. Not to mention sliding in a 4% staff benefit fund is dirty and is giving \u201cowners are too greedy to pay their own staff\u201d. Lowkey giving poor. Keep the money don\u2019t need a refund. Just absolutely disgusted by the high pricing and low quality food.  at least their ranch seems to be homemade and isn\u2019t half bad. Been dying to try this place for a while. Several friends recommended it. They do an incredible job on fun vibes, great service and killer sauces.\n\nMain reason for 4 stars vs 5 is the actual size of the wings are quite small. For the price, we expected the wings to be larger. We each ordered 9 wings and still felt hungry.\n\nWe had a friend try the El Jefe Challenge. Kind of a joke. 15 wings in 3.5 min without your mouth on fire is a challenge. He got five wings in. \ud83d\udd25\nNot worth it. $20 wasted. \ud83d\ude1d\n\n\ud83d\udcf8 Click the photos to see what we ordered. Edit: updating to 2/5.  It\u2019s just a borderline scam for the amount of food you get for the price.\n\nOriginal review below:\n\nCouldn't decide on a 2 or a 3 here, so officially giving a 2.5/5.  Popeyes makes better wings for cheaper.\n\nThe tenders are expensive and do not meet the taste+quality to meet that price (at best, $3 per tender), since you can probably beat these out at home with minimal effort.  They do not fare well in a takeout scenario (they get super soggy and sad after ~10 minutes).  They also messed up my order and only gave me 8 tenders when I ordered 10.\n\nOverall, on a good day this might be worth 3-4 stars.  The chicken is good quality and I'm sure when fresh there is some crisp to these.  But I should get more food for my money here in my opinion - too many better options at the same price.\n\nThe sauces I had I was not a fan of.  A lot of their hot sauces taste very similar.  The sweet BBQ was fantastic in my opinion though.\n\nWhile I didn't dine inside, it looked like a cool spot.  The location is nice for all of the locals and would make a good 3rd place for beer.\n\nI'm glad I tried it, but will stick to Popeyes if it's a choice between this place and them.  I'd consider coming again and seeing if some of their peanut sauces are worth trying as I didn't try those and they looked interesting. The actual location, staff and atmosphere here are great and welcoming. The daily specials are cool and the beer selection is good.\n\nThe wings that I got were tiny but the flavor was really good and they gave me more than the 9 I ordered to make up for the size."

    "reviews": "Super duper cool rooftop spot. Really liked the indoor and outdoor seating area on 2nd floor. Service was good and staff were friendly.\n\nThe buffalo chicken wrap was not good at all. We both got it and were very disappointed. The wrap itself is far too big for the contents. Buffalo sauce, a side salad and little bit of chicken inside. Very strange blue cheese dressing too. I\u2019ll be back for the atmosphere and drinks but we will skip on the food. This spot is lively and fun on Friday and Saturday nights, especially with the live music setting the vibe. There\u2019s a variety of food and drink options, though prices are a bit on the higher side and the happy hour menu is somewhat limited. Most people come for the energetic atmosphere, live music, and the patio with great views. Later in the night, it gets pretty busy\u2014there are no servers, so you\u2019ll need to take turns ordering food and drinks at the bar, and you definitely have to hold down your table if you want to keep your spot. Seating can be hard to find on live music nights, but overall, it\u2019s a fun place worth checking out. Super cool venue. The rooftop was closed officially for a rainy day during brunch but! We stopped up there for the view \ud83d\ude0d Still got seated, helped out at the counter right away and everyone was very friendly. Got the burn down breakfast and a pineapple mimosa and it was\ud83d\ude2e\u200d\ud83d\udca8\ud83e\udd0c\ud83c\udffb perfection. Will be back for rooftop vibes later this summer! bRUNch run club usually chooses amazing spots, and this is one of them!\nToday was my first visit in BurnDown, and I absolutely loved it. Very, very cool spot and decor, multiple floors and atmosphere that told me a burger would be the right option.\nWe ordered the brunch options - Classic breakfast and the Hangover Burger (with gluten free modifications). The breakfast was good, the burger was awesome.\nAs many people before have said - GF positions and GF modifications are clearly marked in the menu, and the place overall is pretty careful. Will be back! really really cute place for young people or even a large group.\n4 floors with a rooftop patio included\nplenty of great bar food and drinks\ni think this place deserves some more credit.\ngot the buffalo chicken wrap. sooo good.\nonly thing i would say is the fries had a sweet kick to them idk if it was the parsley so maybe just salt and pepper for those next time !!"

    "reviews": "I agree with the latest comment. There\u2019s something up with the service. I\u2019ve lived in the area for a few years now and have given this place more chances than I can count to get it right.\n\nThey recently changed the menu increasing prices and keeping quality the same (if not worse).\n\nThe guy next to me ordered a chicken sandwich and it looked amazing. I ordered the same one and noticed how the chef making the food switched to a different person. He literally cut the chicken after frying it to fit the size of the bun. Looked different than the sandwich the other guy ordered :(\n\nIdk what\u2019s up with this place but at this point I don\u2019t expect to get good service. Maybe I\u2019m blacklisted or something but I\u2019m always respectful to everyone and try to bring positive vibes wherever I go. I\u2019m not a person of color and will no longer support this place. Enough is enough. Food decent atmosphere is decent. But service quality is greatly lacking. At least for me when I go there with friends. Been over a handful of times as I live close and my girl enjoys it. I\u2019m not saying any one is actually racist but I do feel a shift of energy when it comes to my service.\n\nBeing left without a waiter for over 20 min to take my order while I watch them repeatedly check on other guests as we sit there looking at them to try to let them know we\u2019ve been ready for 20 min.\n\nConstantly asked for my id when I\u2019ve already showed the person taking my order. Why would you ask if you\u2019re not my waiter and I already showed my waiter.\n\nOrdering online just to show up at the pic up time and they haven\u2019t even started yet so have to wait another 20-30 min for our food.\n\nGreatly understaffed\n\nAnd just overall feel a little singled out as the only person of color in there usually when I\u2019m there and notice everyone having a good time but then when they come to my table the energy shifts a lil. I try to be kind and pull it back but i just at this point don\u2019t feel welcomed as there\u2019s always something when I go. Again not sayin anyone is racist or discriminatory! I\u2019m just saying I personally don\u2019t feel welcomed.\n\nDecent place tho if you don\u2019t mind the service. Not saying don\u2019t check it out it might be nice for you. But for me I dread it. And will never be back or support this place at all. Great dive bar for some pints, sports, or to hangout outside and drink in the summer! The food is mediocre, but that\u2019s not why we go. Walk here regularly in the summer for a pint, quick burger, and a game.  Owner also responded to my comment which you love to see that they care! One of my favorite bars in Denver. It\u2019s a popular spot (!) and a great place to meet your neighbors. Fried pickles are a must and the service is always awesome. Shoutout to GM Meagan who does an amazing job, she is always so welcoming. When there\u2019s a Nuggets game on it\u2019s always packed with great energy. Love it! I initially wrote a bad review of this spot because of the attitude of the bartender on multiple occasions. I have been back several times due to the proximity and they have been amazing. Tonight I came in and I\u2019ve had a rough few weeks and they comped my meal and made good conversation.\nI work in the industry and I get that sometimes we are having a rough time. They are clearly working hard to make sure things are going well here.\nCheers to the bartenders on 2/20, they were super friendly."

    "reviews": "I was celebrating a birthday party for Doctor x Security was great. The gentleman at the front door are awesome. They have Pretty Woman there, but there should be more. And I would like to see more curves. But all in all, we enjoyed ourselves. Great club - very pretty girls - most are very slender and fit.  Friendly staff and dancers.  $40 lap dances. Had fun.\n\nDidn't eat. Just gave 5 stars because everything else was on point . I had a really disappointing experience at Shotgun Nightclub. Despite following all the rules and just trying to enjoy the night, I was kicked out without any clear explanation. I wasn\u2019t causing any problems, yet the staff treated me unfairly and gave no reason for their actions.\n\nIt\u2019s frustrating to be treated like that, especially when you\u2019re just out to have a good time. I hope the management takes a serious look at how their security team handles situations, because no one deserves to be treated this way.\n\nUntil they improve their customer service and show more respect to guests, I won\u2019t be coming back\u2014and I\u2019d caution others to think twice before going. Decided to check this place out when I had a layover on a Tuesday evening The reviews were bit odd seemed like mixed of disgruntled, genuine bot reviews. I heard about this place from a manager from a different strip club. I was surprised how cool the club is in general.\n\nThe atmosphere was great, music was pretty good, big and stylish club. The drink prices were good and the hospitality from the door to the bartender that night was good. They did have a handful of really attractive dancers and most of them did come up to me. They were nice, talkative and really no sales pressure. They said it was a bit dead for a Tuesday night but I think otherwise I thought it was fairly busy. Felt more like a Thursday than Tuesday.\n\nWell definitely hit up this place again if I'm in the area. Treating ride share drivers who show up to safely transport your drunk patrons like dirt, your security is standing on the sidewalk SCREAMING at ride share drivers stopping on the PUBLIC road that you DO NOT OWN - when you cone off your driveway!!!!!!. You do that again, I swear I will \"break down\" right at your exit thoroughly enjoying cancelling the ride and just hanging out. And I will post my dash cam video. DO BETTER."

I often come by myself for all day Monday happy hour since my partner is not a huge seafood fan (lame) \ud83d\ude09\nRecently, if you don't have a reservation they have an outdoor patio where a server will bring you a cocktail or mocktail. It is really nice. Laid back atmosphere with top notch food and great happy hour. Our server Erica was amazing! We had a party of 7 with a lot of food allergies, Erica took her time with us and made sure all of our food came out perfect. (Thank you kitchen!!) Erica also kept a cake in the fridge for us, asked the kitchen for something to cut  it with, she lit the candles, and carried our cake to our table for our 80 year old birthday queen!! Everything was wonderful! We will definitely be back!! This is one of my favorite places in the Denver area to grab oysters and other good seafood. Drinks are phenomenal as well. I did their New Year's Eve experience in 2023 and 2024 and would highly recommend. Very well run establishment as well! I came to the restaurant and made a take-out order. This tuna costs $47+ tax. The quality of this tuna is very poor. You can see the veins that shouldn't be there. They brought it to me 5 minutes after I made the order, which obviously had been prepared long before I made the order. This used to be our favorite restaurant, but recently we had some disappointments. Particularly on the 17 th of April we came at around 8.15 pm and they greeted us armed with brooms and dust pans. Big group of staff was busy putting chairs up and another one was busy with stashing /slamming dishes, the bartenders were busy putting things away and etc. which made us unwanted and uncomfortable. I wish we left prior ordering. We weren\u2019t the only customers and after us two more couples came in. The food as aways was amazing as the quality of the oysters too. Our bartender seem new and we felt that she is pressured by the rest of the team to hurry us up. I really wish they told us that they are closing instead of serving us. We did not enjoy our experience and it was not worth the money. There was literally no atmosphere that night We also believe that the halibut is overpriced for the amount of the serving comparing to other restaurants. We wish your restaurant understands the importance of having regulars and keep them consistently satisfied."

    "reviews": "I was interested in trying out the restaurant due to a friend who had mentioned it.  We came within a few weeks of the recommendation. Upon being seated, we found our waitress to be nice and attentive.  Prices did seem a little steep on certain dishes, but some prices were standard. I decided to select the Gyro dish. I think the dish tasted pretty decent. What turned me off was the fact that the wrap literally would drip oil every time I took a bite. It was quite off-putting. I don't think I've ever experienced a dish do that before.  What's interesting for me is that I went to a restaurant a month prior and ordered a similar dish, and it did not have copious amounts of grease in the dish. The price was even about the same, but the meat provided was twice the amount compared to here. I can\u2019t decide what is better the food or the service!! Our waitress Mags was so witty and helpful. The drinks were amazing, mango mimosa for the win! My boys ordered the chicken fried chicken and chicken fried steak and they were beyond impressed. I got the caprese avocado toast with homemade balsamic and my taste buds were in heaven! 10/10 recommend. We will be back again soon \ud83d\ude0a First time visiting Sams from a recommendation from a friend. Food was pretty good. We both got burgers the only complaint i have is with the burgers, whatever seasoning they are using takes away the flavor of a fresh burger and not a good choice. The patties are huge just wished it had that fresh taste like a good burger should have. We both didn't care for the seasoning it ruin the meat it was over powering. Just salt, pepper even a little garlic would of been better and allow that good flavor from a good piece of meat and it would of been a great burger. I was unable to finish mine it just didn't taste good.\n\nI use to manage restaurants so things catch my eye more than other people may not see. One of the cooks kept touching his hat and adjusting it and just kept grabbing it nearly the whole time we were there. It was unsettling to see that and we hoped he was a grill person and not making our sandwiches, from what i could tell that was the case, but still it shouldn't be happening in the kitchen without washing his hands after and the excessive amounts it was happening was to much.\n\nEverything else was nice and our service was great. We will try again in the future to try some other dinner items. They have a huge menu. The best brunch place in Denver !!!! I love everything there. Ask be served with Parker , she\u2019s super sweet, professional and always making sure we are doing okay . Her lattes are the best I\u2019ve ever had ( no fat , sugar free) so it\u2019s kinda hard to find good ones . I love her and would always asked for her service ! I\u2019m not from\nHere, but potentially coming back here ! This place is a true hidden gem. If you like those old dinners with a twist this is your place. It has a sports bar area and the food.\nGolly the food. My wife and I had the pancake sand and the waffle sand and I'm telling you!! It was amazing the cook did his job and our wonderful waitress Kaitlyn did hers! I highly recommend her! She was a great server and was very attentive and punctual. Couldn't ask for more at a lovely place like Sam's! A true gem in the Greendale area.\nIf you are looking for good food, good service and a great atmosphere look no further than Sam's No.3 in Glendale! You won't be disappointed."

    "reviews": "Restaurant modeled after a ski chalet. Varied menu including burgers. The black and bleu was good except the menu described it as having saut\u00e9ed onions and it included a large slice of raw red onion instead. The fries were good, but there were a lot of them. The best thing was the Basque cheesecake for dessert.\n\nService was fast and friendly. The space itself was rather dark especially coming in on a sunny day. They do have a patio to dine outside in good weather. Several TVs were showing mostly sports. They do have password protected Wi-Fi available for customers.\n\nParking was plentiful on a weekday afternoon, but can be problematic during peak hours. Be sure to ask for a copy of your receipt if paying with a card, and monitor your statements closely. I visited on 5/21 and closed out my tab for approximately $49.00, including tip. However, the total that posted to my card was $99.60. I have disputed the charge with my bank, but it's concerning that staff appears to have added an extra $50 to the tip.\n\n**UPDATE 5/30/25**\n\nManagement responded to my review on 5/26 stating: \"Hello, Please call and we will adjust your credit card, it was most likely human error. We would be happy to correct. Love, Inga's.\" I called and spoke with the manager, Cindy, who looked up the transaction and confirmed that a tip of over $60 had been entered in their system\u2014roughly 200%. I explained that this was incorrect and asked her to verify it against the signed receipt. She said she would locate the receipt and call me back. I never received a call, and the business later deleted their response to my original review.  This is an extremely shady business. Stay away. Please double check your tabs and take a printed copy with you I have noticed my transactions will clear for more than what I signed for at the bar. If I ever go to Ingas again I will ensure I pay cash only. I was there with my sister and we paid $62 + tip then when the transaction cleared it was $101, they sent the itemized and clearly added more drinks than we consumed. I have been in the industry a long time and have never seen such shady behavior from service staff. Watch your tabs. Ended up going to Ingas last night after me and my friend left a different bar since it was crowded, and it was honestly the best choice!\nIt was busy, but there were plenty of places to sit, the vibe was great and Ian was awesome and attentive!\nI'll have to come here on Saturdays more often now! When you walk in all you have to do is look at the floor to know this place has atmosphere and character.  Neat decor, great food (pro tip: ask for Cajun seasoning to be added to the Black and Blue Burger), solid service, and creative bartenders (I asked them to essentially invent a drink on the spot and wasn't disappointed - ended up having three surprise drinks).  Also, this is a plus in my book: they provide free female sanitary products.  Also, LOTS of board games, trivia and other events...I wish I lived closer.  You won't be disappointed!"

    "reviews": "The Burger was Phenomenal and the drink amazing, the Server Brandie was one of the nicest and most friendly than I've seen in a while 100 percent will return. QUITE LITERALLY THE BEST BURGER SPOT KNOWN TO MAN.\n\nI cannot express how wonderful this place is. This is always a first choice spot EVERYDAY of the week.\n\n(please bring a park burger to (park)er, co\ud83d\ude01 It\u2019s been a minute since we\u2019ve been back.  Burgers are now on plates where they used to in baskets.  Nice touch, not that the baskets ever bothered me.  This PB on Holly was choice for us, not too crowded, nobody getting too loud and TVs/music are at a nice level.\n\nBurgers, fries, service seems to be as good as ever.  Attentive but not overbearing and they had no trouble with med-rare burger, fries well done/extra crispy!  I\u2019d put this burger up there against just about any in the city!\n\nOh and nice soap and lotion in the bathrooms now too!\n\nThx team! Burger is great, fries are good.\nUsed to be my favorite place to get a burger, until I got a puppy. I\u2019m disappointed with their dog policy, they\u2019re not allowing dogs \u201cdue to Denver health code\u201d, but health code allows them to have dogs on the patio. I can\u2019t leave my dog by itself, I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll be coming here any time soon. I paid almost $50 for 2 burgers, kids burger and fries - and have to eat it in my car, without an option to use a restroom or to order a drink. It\u2019s disappointing. We ate at Park Burger last week, we went for a casual dinner night out after our daughter's volleyball game, last Wednesday night.\nThe staff was very friendly, the food was divine!\nI had an ahi tuna burger on a gluten free bun.\nMy husband loved his cob salad and chicken wings and our daughter enjoyed the kids burger alone with her milkshake. We ordered the delicious house potato chip with blue cheese, it was totally delicious.\nWe had some zero alcohol drinks that were yummy\u2764\ufe0f\nWe will definitely come back for more. Thank you for the wonderful food."

Looks like I got half the steak spread out on cut in half. Not cool, not cool at all. p.s. Second picture is the half of a half put back together. I haven\u2019t eaten here in years.\nMy last experience wasn\u2019t the best.\nI had a good waiter. I\u2019m a make my way back to become reacquainted with the restaurant and food. Me and my daughter went here tonight since we won\u2019t be able to do anything for Mother\u2019s Day. She\u2019s been craving a really good burger lately and I\u2019ve been craving cat fish. I saw this place sold catfish, so I was all for it.\nI have never been here, so I had no idea what to do the moment I walked in the door. We were never greeted or even acknowledged. After standing at the stairs looking confused, a male staff said we could sit where ever we liked. My daughter wanted to sit near the pool table but then we ended up going outside. On our way to our first table, one of the waitresses was walking past us, and I complimented her hair. She gave me the most rude look ever and said annoyed sounding \u201cthanks\u201d. When we sat outside there was a waitress out there and she looked at us, continued what she was doing and then left. We waited over 7 minutes and didn\u2019t even know what we were suppose to be doing or how to order.\nAfter about 10 minutes of sitting there, and people staring at us, we finally decided to leave!\nAwful experience, very unwelcoming! Really excellent. The ribs were incredible. The BBQ sauce was sweet and tangy. Everything was really good. The servers were also awesome. She let me switch out my soda choice :) Warning/Waste of time and money : New staff and the food and service has completely went down the drain\u2026 The guy manager is definitely not a good representation of the company and lacks managerial skills. Used to enjoy going on Friday\u2019s for the fish and gumbo but every time I go, the quality of food and service gets worse\u2026 The catfish had a thick coating and not fried evenly around so some parts were soggy and floppy. The breading on the crab cakes were soggy like they just warmed them up in the microwave instead of frying them. Don\u2019t waste your time or money.\nHorrible food and service."

They have spice levels to accommodate everyone and the food is clearly very fresh. Highly recommended! The food here was so good! They have an amazing mango lassi and the butter chicken was delicious with the garlic naan. I would definitely come back and try more food, they have a variety of options. They also let you decide the spice level if you prefer less or more spicy food. Everyone there was super nice and the portion sizes were good. Wow! I went with my family and I am so impressed with their entire staff! I recently adopted a no sodium/low sodium vegetarian diet. When I asked for the accommodations the waitress was so kind and helpful. Then the food was AMAZING!!!! I loved their offerings and later when I went home and took my blood pressure it was perfect! Usually dining out causes a spike but this meal was made just as I asked. I'll definitely be back frequently!!! \ud83e\udd70\ud83c\udf39\ud83c\udf37\ud83c\udf3f Stopped by this place for lunch. The waitstaff was friendly and informative. The flavors were fantastic. Enjoyed every dish and had a nice balance of spices and heat. The portions were quite large.  The music videos playing were a fun background noise. Would go again. Had Taz delivered tonight and ate it so fast I didn't have time to take a picture. The chicken korma was AMAZING. I'd say the spice levels are pretty low (I ordered medium and it was more mild), so I'd say order one level up.\n\nNaan is great. Solid standard Indian fare that will be a go-to for me in the future for sure."

Make  sure to ask for Lindsay I've passed by this spot SOOOO many times, man have I been missing out. Great service Lexi was on top of everything. The atmosphere is low key and the food was awesome. It was starting to become very busy due to it being Saturday and the Nuggets and the Kentucky Derby. Great music, great drinks, and great staff. We only ordered a few cocktails each, which were all excellent, and the staff was very kind and quick to provide."

    "reviews": "Madison our server made it a great experience. The atmosphere made me smile from the time I walked in to the time I walked out. There is room for large parties, and cozy 2 seat booths. Clean floors and a clean bathroom always put my mind at ease. What a pleasure it was when food arrived. Cooked and seasoned to perfection. Two thumbs up from the sultans of food. I will always hit up BJ's Restaurant and Brewhouse when in Denver. Sleek restaurant with a large bar and some TVs. The menu is varied and interesting. The Brewhouse Philly is their take on a cheesesteak. The sandwich was slightly smaller than expected, but the steak was very good. The fries that came with it would have benefitted from less salt, but were otherwise okay. There were a lot of them.\n\nService was fast and friendly when it came to ordering. The sandwich took between 30 and 40 minutes to come out. The space was modern and comfortable. The screens were only showing two channels, but nothing interesting was going on. It would have been better if I had chosen a different day/time when live sports were running. The music playing was too loud for me. They do have unsecured Wi-Fi for customers.\n\nThere are lots of parking spaces available. Our waiter was great! Just went in for the $5 pizookie and it came out super quick. Got the cookies and cream one. Could\u2019ve went a little lighter on the cream, but still satisfied my sweet tooth. Waiter messed up our bill but quickly corrected it when we pointed it out and was so polite! Will be returning. Absolutely amazing service! I have celiac and they gave me a gluten sensitive menu! They have a gluten free skillet cookie and took cross contamination precautions! Very thoughtful and overall good experience! Did not know what to expect when I decided to have lunch here because of the reviews I saw on Google map. But I can definitely say it is worth dining here.\nI've had several items from the menu, they were all tasty beside the avocado egg roll that I did not enjoy as the others. Clam Chowder in a bread bowl was warm and great option as an appetizer. California flat bread was crispy and fresh. The spicy peanut chicken noodle was so creative; I wouldn't recommend it for everyone cuz it has very unique flavors.\nWe also got the $13 dollar deal of mini deep dish pizza, salad and pizookie. I decided to go with BBQ chicken deep pizza and it was fantastic.\nIf there is anything extremely unique and that would make me want to go back it would have to be the salted caramel pizookie. It was amazing. The cinnamon roll pizookie was also good but it's extremely sweet/sugary so would go with the cookie instead.\nThe atmosphere and service deserve a five star."

    "reviews": "You'd think the hipster-est place for hipster breakfast would live up to its hipster-y hype.\n\nIt doesn't, the place was not only a deadzone for a good meal, but the place is filled with dejected soccer moms with no real tenacity to cook for their kid. In front and behind the counter.\n\nAnd once I finally got my grub, it was lukewarm. Like they just happen to find my order in a microwave in the back and hand it to me. I can see why the neaby burger joint is always packed. I ordered from this store in the app, they didn't have my order, told me to go to the other store down the road.  The manager called and told the other store my order was there.  30 minutes later I picked up my order and the manager didn't apologize but did offer me something for \"free\" while laughing about it.  Not very funny and horrible customer service. Almost everything is perfect, and you won't find a better ratio of coffee beverage to price ratio. The only complaint I have is that, even with specifying lightly toasted, I'll still sometimes get a bagel with toppings that are burnt to the point of smelling like a house fire and tasting as such.\n\nIf you get a bagel with toppings (or \"sensitive\" toppings), and even if you say lightly toasted, just make sure to check your sandwich before leaving. Even as such, they are quick to remedy the problem and it's never been much of an issue... but I do have to mention it for the amount of times it has happened. skimpy on the cream cheese, no whipped cream on my caramel macchiato, and asked for a tip in  the drive-through; give me a break! went through the drive-through, the guy was not friendly and as I was ordering, just kept saying what else what else, never greeted me never said thank you.. I know it might seem petty, but sometimes that makes a huge difference and then they have the nerve to have a tip jar as well as asking for a tip on their credit card reader like dude you're literally talking through a microphone,  that's not hard, you're not serving me, you're not making the food , and not friendly.. you get paid hourly that's enough.. then have the nerve to ask for a tip, which is funny.. like I'm not tipping bad customer service.. and reading the reviews I'm surprised nothing has changed as yet saying people are contacted about their experience but yet all this time later the experience that people are having hasn't changed for the better.. says a lot maybe retraining is needed and or replacing the staff that currently worked there if at all possible so you have a fresh start and maybe some friendly faces."

If you\u2019re in the Denver area, make sure to visit this place. The Pho was amazing, the combination Bun Dac Biet and the grilled shrimp spring roll were excellent!! And the Boba is the best. Service was also excellent and the staff was wonderful!! Our go to pho place in the area. The service is always good and the food is delicious. I definitely recommend checking them out. Also a super affordable meal that will leave you nice and full! Friendly service and dog-friendly outdoor patio - they even brought water for our dogs. Reasonable prices and good portions. The bowls of pho pictured are small and medium. The large is REALLY large! The spring rolls were good too They have remodeled since I was here last! It looks great, always so clean! Anthony was our server tonight, he was amazing, we didn't want for anything!  The food was great also!  They do take out too! But we love eating here! I got the small brisket bowl,  and we got the Vietnamese egg rolls as an appetizer."

First time, will definitely recommend and return Am l'm so glad we went here for my birthday last night 03- 04 - 24,\nthere was 5 of us in my group,  and there were a few other couples there but it wasn't too busy, but then we got there around 7: 30 and they close at 8 pm , but they let us stay  and order and eat. We had a couple of appetizers, loaded tater tots, and cheese sticks and the those dipping sauce were the best in house made I've had in along time especially the marinara sauce,( I really want there recipe) every one was very pleased with there dinners they had ordered I had a  CFS Dinner with mashed potatoes,  and broccoli rice casserole, my youngest granddaughter had Shepherd pie, and onion rings, and my oldest granddaughter had the mashed potatoes bowl,  Which is Chicken chicken tenders and corn with mashed potatoes and gravy and  cheese on top .my daughter had rib eye steak , Fried okra and squash casserole. And my son in law had liver and onions with gravy and a Caesar salad, . The thing is this was a lot of food and I only seen one server and he waited on us with a smile and kindness and patience  and he took care of the other people in the restaurant as well. I didn't catch his name but he did a fantastic job \ud83d\udc4f and since it was my birthday they gave me a cherry cobbler with icecream on top it was delicious and enjoyed it with everyone at the table , all the food was delicious home cooked meal \ud83d\ude0b  this place is like a cute hidden little jem, the atmosphere was very pleasant it wasn't loud or noisy every body could talk at a soft  normal tone and be heard with bothering others guests in the restaurant , I highly recommend this Black eyed pea restaurant.

The portions were very ample and we took enough leftovers home for several meals.\n\nI appears that many of the customers are long time regulars and that was very comforting. Was the food \u201cI would drive a hundred miles to get some good\u201d? No, but if I was hungry and within 5-10 miles then it would absolutely be a contender.\n\nWhile the restaurant was very clean, it is starting to show its age. Hopefully they will have an opportunity for a refresh soon.\n\nOverall, give them a shot. With their diverse menu you should be able to find something that appeals to. Where else can you go and get breakfast served all day, plus Mexican, American and Greek menu options? Family ran business for more than 46 years. The owner is a real sweetheart who takes pride in her food with good reason. Large portions too. My wife and I chose the Greek dishes and they both had great flavor, the meats were marinated and cooked just right. Pita bread was made fresh and served hot. The desserts are homemade and some of the best I've ever had. Be SURE to try their BAKLAVA with some vanilla ice cream. Servers were very friendly and personable. Dining area was clean and well maintained.\n\nLook at my other reviews, I rarely give out 5 stars, but this place earned it for sure. I can't wait to return and try more dishes. It's a local favorite with many repeat customers. We drove past a couple weeks ago, noticed it was super busy, so we made a mental note to come back and try it.  We went yesterday and was a bit worried after we saw the prices on the menu, they were a bit high for diner food.  We ordered a BLT with Fries and a Greek Spring quesadilla.  When they came out the BLT had probably an inch of perfect bacon and a large amount of home fries and the quesadilla was ginormous!  Not only was it large portions but the food tasted amazing.  The honey mustard that came with the quesadilla (I know weird combo) was fantastic.  The staff were attentive and very friendly.  The decor was quite dated but this business has been around for 40+ years.  They know what they\u2019re doing!  GO to this restaurant it\u2019s SO yummy! Everything about this place is AMAZING!! The food is all-ways very tasty, and the service is attentive and friendly. There the type of family restaurant to remember your face and great you with excitement when you return.\nThe portions are huge, and the food never disappoints. Excellent service, delicious food, and good portion size!!"

You can use hot sauces that they make - the garlic red was my favorite.\n\nThe bloodsucker ale is made with beets and apples, and I loved it but if you dont like beets, dont get it as the taste comes through. Because I love beets, I found this beer earthy and drinkable.\n\nAlso tried the spiritual sesh (my favorite - complex and sweet), petal to the metal (tastes like spring - very floral),  beer hammer (very sweet, very very strong, almost like if whiskey and mead made a baby), el colorado chile (light and garden forward), and cluster fux (light, effervescent, citrusey and cider-like).\n\nService here was great and charming, as well as the art and music. I highly recommend for people who want a humble, genuine place and a great time. I had an exceptional time. Service was great. Staff was friendly and very helpful. The food is amazing!! Will keep going back every time I'm in Denver!! This place use to have awesome pizza. Here\u2019s what a $8.50 slice of pizza looks like at this place now. Prices have skyrocketed and service has gone down. I asked about the $11, 2 slices and a soda lunch special and she said that\u2019s for onion and red sauce only pizza or something useless along those lines. The bartender was way too cool for school, lol. I\u2019ve only been here a handful of times but I\u2019ll definitely never be back! Cool spot. Wish we tried the pizza. We were lucky enough to catch the 11 year anniversary show. Beer was good! I would recommend. Black Sky was the first place I noticed when I moved to the area and has now become a weekly regular.

    "reviews": "Having relocated from South Carolina, I appreciate this place very much.\nThe sliced brisket and chopped brisket sandwiches were delicious. I was fortunate to get their last serving of burnt ends which are amazing!  The catfish was also over the top.\nSides were all good to very good. The Mac and cheese was somewhere between a good normal version and a full fledged SC baked dish - not the best but yummy.\nSeveral BBQ sauces along with hot sauces, pickles, onions and jalape\u00f1os are plentiful.\nStaff was attentive. Chairs inside were not very comfortable.\nMeal for 4 with water was $80 with a tip. Well worth it!\nEnjoy! First time stopping in and glad I did. The spicy and the bold BBQ sauces were definitely my favorite. The brisket was tender and the hot link  had good favor. The fries were good, Mac and cheese was fine.... But overall great meal. Plus they have Diet Dr Pepper which is always a plus to me lol I\u2019ve spent my life on a quest for truly great BBQ across the US\u2014usually ending in disappointment, an emptier wallet, and a side of regret. Not this time!\n\nOur first visit to Smokin\u2019 Yard\u2019s was Mother\u2019s Day 2025, and it delivered the best BBQ we\u2019ve ever had. Pulling into the car park, we spotted several trucks with Texas plates\u2014evidence that this BBQ in Colorado is so good even Texans will drive up for it. Clearly, these folks know their barbecue.\n\nNo snake oil here\u2014these meats cure everything from depression to hanger. We dove in hard with the pulled chicken, brisket, and short ribs. Their sauces deserve their own psalm; mixing chipotle and bold was a true hymn to my taste buds.\n\nThe sides are main-course material. My 7-year-old declared the mac & cheese the best she\u2019s ever had (although mom\u2019s homemade still takes gold). The mashed potatoes looked like twin scoops of comfort and joy\u2014supernatural potatoes, I swear.\n\nOut front, a cheeky pig statue puffed on a cigar\u2014perfect for photos without worrying it\u2019d hog the spotlight.\n\nIf Moses had known about BBQ this miraculous when God sent quail in the desert, he might\u2019ve etched a second set of commandments to include: \u201cThou shalt feast at Smokin\u2019 Yard\u2019s.\u201d\n\n\u2014Moses-approved! Top tier BBQ spot! It's definitely now my top choice for BBQ! Nothing was dry. Everything was well seasoned, smoked, tender, and flavorful. The atmosphere was clean, inviting with a mix of blues and country. The service was also great with the staff consistently checking and refilling drinks. For the past 4 years, I\u2019ve been traveling around Colorado trying and reviewing BBQ restraunts, and Smokin Yard is easily my most highly recommended spot being based in Boulder. I was extremely excited to try it, so I gathered up some friends and we made the trek down to lower Denver to try the highly acclaimed BBQ joint.\n\nThe service definitely felt rushed and they were moving around quickly, but everyone we interacted was nice as a peach. No complaints on quality of service.\n\nWhen it comes to the food, I was definitely pretty disappointed in the quality of the meat. You couldn\u2019t really taste any sort of smoke, the meat was textureless, and to be honest entirely tasteless unless you smothered it in one of their BBQ sauces. Their BBQ sauces all tasted nearly identical to me, just different levels of heat, something I\u2019d never encountered before.\n\nThe drinks were hefty and the unsweet tea was great, but I did think it was odd they had to refill it for you so you\u2019d often be out of tea for a few minutes while eating. The sides were again tasteless, seasoned with nothing but salt. The sweet potato fries an excellent sample of nothing but a saltless mush.\n\nOverall, we all averaged our ratings to a 6.5/10."

    "reviews": "Such an Irish experience with amazing food. The smell alone will bring you in. The atmosphere is just a cherry on top This is one of the top 5 bars in Denver in my opinion, and perhaps number 1. The food is solid, the Guinness is the finest pour in town, and the staff is fantastic. The door folks are stern (in a great, safe way), and friendly to highest degree. The bar staff is efficient and friendly. Ashley is the best!! Thanks Dougherty\u2019s, yall rock. One of my favorite Broadway bars\u2014perfect for a casual hangout with a mix of friendly people who are always up for a good chat. The atmosphere strikes a great balance between lively and relaxed, with a cozy bar area and a fantastic outdoor patio.\n\nThe service is consistently excellent, and the staff always makes you feel welcome. Whether you're in for drinks or food, they deliver quality.\n\nWith no wait times and reasonable prices, it\u2019s one of the few remaining go-to \"local\" joints. Had some great booze and bar food for a good price.  Plus they actually cooked my burger to temp which is rare for a pub - props to them!  4/5 - I\u2019ll definitely keep this place in mind for a late night option! This is a wonderful place. I\u2019ve not had Guinness this good since I lived in London a few years back. The food is delicious. The Irish Nachos are great, and that\u2019s coming from a Texan who loves a good nacho dish.  We also had the BLT, Shepherd\u2019s Pie, and Grilled Cheese and fries, all excellent. The lady enjoyed the Wed special pink drink also.\n\nThe service is very attentive. I\u2019m glad I took the recommendation from a dear friend to visit, and brought family with me.\n\nThere\u2019s paid parking a couple of blocks away so don\u2019t let the streets scare you off. It\u2019s worth a couple of bucks to park for such a nice experience!"

    "reviews": "Styles and Ray are so awesome! I literally come to hangout and catch up with them. Love supporting Historians but when those two are on shift together, its like watching Tony Parker and Tim Duncan! Legends. We have been to the place a couple times for drinks. Great staff, and drinks are delish, plus they have a wide selection of beer on tap.\nTonight my husband and I visited the Historian  to try their Fryday Fishn\u2019 Chips special.\nIt was the best fish fry we have had here in Denver or anywhere west of the Mississippi!\nAlso, the special includes a drink (which is included in the $12.78price)!\nGreat food, drinks and people.\nThe staff is attentive but not overly in your face.\nRay is one of the weekend bartenders. He is a great server with a great personality too!\nWe highly recommend! An awesome place to hang out and enjoy some lunch! We decided to eat here during some vintage shopping on Broadway. The Hot Chicken Sandwich and the drinks were refreshing and delicious. The fries were nice and crispy as well. Sit and check out the rooftop upstairs. The view and the staff up there were amazing with great music playing in the background. Highly recommend this place! Awesome rooftop patio, came for brunch and the tots were delicious. My server Rileigh was attentive and so welcoming! Definitely will be back. I've got mixed feelings about this place. I've now been twice, about a year apart, and recently they have done away with table service and posted notices of increased prices. Increased prices but no table service? This most recent visit we went at about 3:30 on a Monday so there wasn't any wait to order or get our food and drinks. That's great but what happens when it gets as busy as it was when I visited on a weekend a year ago? I imagine the bar gets swamped given they have to take food and drink orders and the outgoing food is picked up at the same place. I really like the food and drinks. The Steak Arugula salad and BLT Caesar Chicken salad are both great, the fish and chips too. I haven't had a bad drink there, and we've tried just about all of them. On the other hand the high prices mean you can quickly rack up a mean bill, especially if you order an app, an entree, and a drink. Not to mention sides are not included with entrees like burgers so that's an extra cost. The employees are nice and always helpful and the rooftop dining area is great- covered with some shade and plenty of misters.  I'd like to eat here again if I'm in the area but man, not sure if my wallet can handle getting myself and the folks lunch."

    "reviews": "Food is good and usually pretty quick. This place is quickly becoming the new venue of choice for good local punk music and other alt genres. The space is a perfect place to hang out on a Sunday afternoon on the patio, a Friday happy hour or a Saturday night rager. Pretty darn cool place. I've never been here before. Came for a Frickashinas show. They have the bar split in two separate parts. One is the bar with tables etc. and the other is the venue part where the bands play. Good food. Patio. Good service and reasonable prices. Will definitely come again! I was the victim of a violent, antisemitic attack at this bar. A man called me a \u201cdirty Jew\u201d and said I didn\u2019t belong there. I threw water at him in defense of my dignity\u2014he responded by punching me. I called the police. The bar staff did nothing to intervene during the assault and ultimately kicked me out rather than supporting the victim of a hate crime. This establishment tolerated blatant antisemitism and allowed violence against a patron to go unanswered. No one deserves to feel unsafe or unprotected in a public space. Shame on this place for failing to act with basic decency.\n\nResponse to the owner\u2019s reply:\nI want to clarify that my original review reflects my firsthand experience and sincere belief that I was the target of a hate-motivated incident. I was subjected to an antisemitic slur and responded by throwing water. The other individual then struck me physically, and I called the police to report the incident.\n\nMy intent in sharing this is not to defame anyone, but to raise concern about how the situation was handled from my perspective. I\u2019m genuinely disturbed by the owner\u2019s response, which in my view misrepresents what occurred and frames me as the \u201cinstigator\u201d of an encounter I experienced as an unprovoked, hate-driven attack.\n\nI stand by my account: I responded nonviolently to a slur and was physically assaulted. Being removed alongside the aggressor felt like a failure to support someone who was targeted, not a neutral or just resolution.\n\nI believe it\u2019s important for public spaces to prioritize the safety and dignity of all patrons, particularly in the face of hate or discrimination. Sharing this experience is about transparency, not hostility, and I trust that others can decide for themselves whether they\u2019d feel protected in this environment.\n\nIf the bar\u2019s position reflects the values expressed in their response, then it\u2019s clear we operate from different principles. I\u2019ll always stand with those who speak out against hate\u2014and believe victims deserve protection, not blame. I just love Bar 404 for all so many reason! The atmosphere, staff, and owners are all so warm and friendly. But also they do so much to support the community and local musicians and the city of Denver in general. The food and drinks are delicious! Thanks, Bar 404!! We checked this place out for the first time the other night and it was a really fun night. We loved the open patio where we could sit and eat some food while enjoying live music. The waitresses were super nice & the food was yummy as well."

    "reviews": "Amazing staff and experience. I recently lost my ability to walk in February and was admitted into the ICU the week of my birthday. I didn\u2019t get to celebrate on my birthday and it took me a while to be well enough to leave bed. I have been a regular for a couple years now and at the end of our meal I let my waiter( George I think was his name) know that I forgot to order mochi because I was celebrating my birthday. Not only did they cover my ice cream but they gifted me a bottle of sake. The fish is always fresh and amazing and it was a beautifully presented meal.\n\nSuch an amazing experience and motivating experience. Thank you so much for a bit of normalcy and welcoming me it really meant so much to me. I\u2019ve never experienced such kindness from a restaurant before. Thank you again. The better with time Crudo was bonkers- the aioli in particular. I dipped everything in it. I loved the rolls, but they were a mixed bag for my husband in which he preferred the rolls with the crunch. We got the Japanese wagyu piece (that I GENEROUSLY let my husband eat). Unfortunately he was a little disappointed in it- a little bland, which was kind of a bummer for the price/size of portion. There were highs and lows, which balanced out to a solid 4.\n\nBonus points for the hands down moodiest bathroom I\u2019ve ever been in. I know that reviews are regularly hyperbolic, but Go Fish deserves a 6th star if not more.\n\nMy wife and I were stuck at home for her birthday, and I just left a small note asking if they could make it look nice for her. They went above and beyond, and both made me look like a great husband, and legitimately made her night.\n\nI can\u2019t thank y\u2019all enough for that. And the food itself is fantastic, enough so to where we\u2019re stoked to come here for birthdays and special events, and if you\u2019re reading this, so should you.\n\nThank you to the folks working there tonight. You made tonight special. Wonderful vibes here. The sushi is delicious and the drinks are even better. The staff are friendly and awesome! I recently visited this Japanese restaurant and was thoroughly impressed. The fish seemed incredibly fresh and tasted delicious. The service was excellent, with attentive staff who made sure we had everything we needed. There was a wide variety of dishes to choose from, and the place felt very authentic. The prices were reasonable, and the ambiance was great with good music playing in the background. It's been a long time since I've had Japanese food of this quality. Highly recommend!!!"

Such an amazing vibe and I would definitely come back, especially if I knew she was going to be my server We stopped by for drinks and dinner during happy hour and were seated promptly. Jade was our server and she was very friendly and gave great recommendations for the bruschetta board and salad options. Food was yummy! Recommend the sparkling rose. I went to watch my partner perform and I couldn\u2019t be happier with the experience. Amazing staff, really friendly and professional. Food was yummy and they had some really fun Zero-Proof drinks. They took good care of my partner, which is all I care about. another great location! great wait staff. great gluten free bread and options. the skewers are always a great place to start! not a ton of free parking though We just did. DoorDash order from here and it was excellent!  We had the bruschetta and the chef\u2019s charcuterie board - both were excellent.  Will definitely order again and go in person."

    "reviews": "Another stop on the chicken sandwich quest. Loved the grungy bar setting, which set the tone for the white hot chicken sando I got. Great crispiness, lovely flavors, and the slaw was excellent with a surprise of snap peas in there (which is a thing I didn't know I wanted). The spice was hot and burning and tingly, but not the utter joyless death of others. Loved the thick spiral cut fries. All in all, a perfect stop on the chicken quest. It hasn't dethroned SLC's Pretty Bird or Orlando's Chicken Fire, but it's top 5 all time for me. Service is good. You order your own food and drinks. We got their chicken. It was flavorful, but there was an herb that was overpowering the other flavors.\n\nThe chicken is cooked well, juicy, and crunchy. Served hot. Bathrooms are clean. The food was great! We ordered a chicken sandwich (Nashville hot) and chicken tenders (southern), and got two sides (fries and brussel sprouts).\n\nGreat chicken and really good Nashville hot spice. Brussel sprouts were good not great and had a faint mustard coating on them. Fries were solid. Side order portions were very large and not cheap. Seems like they could be smaller and a little less $$ (definitely meant to be shared)\n\nThis location shares space with TRVE brewery. The whole vibe is death metal goblin. There was faint death metal playing the whole time (not in your face). It was okay but certainly down the list of good environment I would think about for lunch or dinner. Beer was good though. This place definitely competes in Denver for one for the best \u201cHot Chicken\u201d joints! Only critique I can say would to season their fries and MacNcheese, but everything else was seasoned to perfection!\n\nTry the Jerk Chicken seasoning for something different but very good and not spicy! Best chicken sandwich of my life! Got the Nashville hot and added some of the maple sauce. So incredible. The reg and sweet potato fries were also amazing. The foodgasm made the metal music bearable. 15/10 food, don\u2019t sleep on this spot!"

    "reviews": "Portions are skimmed! I spent $36 on 2 bowls and some chips and queso. The server/preparer gave me half spoons of everything. My bowls are barely half filled. The server/preparer looked at me after every spoon as if she new it were skimpy portions. The picture I posted is of the limited time surf and turf. I\u2019m beyond irritated with this bowl. I watched who may have been the manager prepare a burrito with full spoon fulls of food, yet this was one of my bowls. I also attached a photo of the chips that came with the chips and queso\u2014not fresh and maybe less than a quarter of the bag had chips.  QDOBA PLEASE BE BETTER THAN THIS\u2026 I\u2019VE ALWAYS PREFERRED YOU OVER CHIPOTLE, but today\u2019s service was not good! \ud83d\udc4e\ud83c\udffd Great experience! I usually load my burritos to high heaven so they usually have a hard time wrapping it, but now here. Andre didn\u2019t skimp on ingredients and wrapped it without an issue. Really chill and open store. They are super nice to me there! They are super nice. It's b\nusy, the food is fresh. They are nice to me, and nowadays, that's very rare. I will go out of my way for Polite courteous service! Loved going to qdoba because they usually hook you up better than chipotle but recently they have been slacking.. especially this location! I got a burrito bowl from this location last night and it was sad. I did an online order\u2014Barely any chicken, no corn elote and no salsa. Didn\u2019t see it until I got home. I have been to this location before and they usually do good but the past two times before they have been barely giving any scoops. I feel ripped off\u2014 this is expensive. You could spare to at least fill up the scoop?! Last night might be my last time at qdoba for a while.\n\nThe picture is the meal from last night\u2026 I\u2019m deleting my old negative review.\nThe quality of the food has been the same, but last time I was here I had a negative experience with the staff.\n\nTonight on 3/16/25 around 8:30 PM they had the most amazing two women working the counters. They made me feel so welcome, and the atmosphere was happy and positive.\n\nQdoba is always going to be Qdoba quality, but the team here is genuinely super kind and competent. The people they employ make it a pleasure to eat here."

    "reviews": "Went at 10 on a Sunday and was able to get a booth right away. Server was friendly and attentive. I ordered the the Sweet Potato Veggie Smash-Up. It came with a poached egg on top and was not only beautifully arranged,  but absolutely delicious.  It was a good light and healthy option. I would recommend to anyone. We order the protein trio omelette and the corned beef omelette. The trio omelette only had ham in it. The ham was grey in color as if it was old. The omelette was very flat & hardly had protein to say the least. My cousin ordered the corned beef omelette, he made sure the specify he wanted extra extra corned beef. The waiter claimed to have understood. When the food came, it barely had any!!! We were very disappointed to say the least. I will never return!!! Good place for some brunch. The staff were great with their friendly service, getting a table was quick, even when it was busy, and the drinks and food were great! The cookies and cream pancake was so, so good. Get that as a starter entree. The Sandwich I Am was a good breakfast sandwich to get with their yummy hash browns. All the rest of the entrees we got were delicious, as well as the drinks. Overall, great place for breakfast! Fantastic breakfast and brunch restaurant, reliable for a solid meal, usually busy on the weekends. They have a modern take on standard menu items - higher quality than a typical diner with fresher ingredients. I typically order their version of a Denver omelet (with red bell peppers) and crispy hash browns. Plenty of boozy drinks or coffee options and real veggie juices. They've mastered Eggs Benedict, the yolk is perfect every time.. Be careful of the Yellow bird hot sauce it can be pretty spicy, but that's the way I like it. Awesome staff, great location on Broadway. Our server, Isaac, was wonderful. Food is very delicious. Lots of gluten free options. Coffee is great. I appreciate how late they are open."

    "reviews": "Breakfast and lunch in long time Cherry Creek establishment. The Garcia omelet was okay. It was a little dry and could have used seasoning, but the pork in it was nicely flavored and the tater tots side was very good. The coffee was good too.\n\nService was fast and friendly. The space itself seemed a little dated although it wasn't bad. They do have password protected Wi-Fi available for guests.\n\nParking can be problematic and/or expensive as is the case anywhere in Cherry Creek. The food that was amazing, and they even let me custom order an item which was combining the coconut French toast into instead of French toast would be pancakes which was amazing. I was really happy that they did it and they did it with no sweat. It didn\u2019t take any longer than any of their other things. The only reason why I\u2019m reading the service a four out of five is because the food is 100 times better than their service even though their service is top-notch. but the atmosphere is kind of really busy and loud really crowded and you don\u2019t feel like you have time to eat all your food because there\u2019s usually a line. That\u2019s why they installed the rule where in order to be seated, you have to have your whole party. Which means you can\u2019t send one person to get seat while your five cousins find parking. Came here for brunch. Got seated quick on a Sunday, which was nice. I got the Hot Hen Skillet and it was decent. My girlfriend got the Kitchen Sink, and also said it was decent. The bacon is really good here. We try to go to this breakfast place when the kids have holidays. It\u2019s a very good breakfast restaurant. The food tastes good. Quick in service.  We have been going for years. The parking can be tricky since it\u2019s in the cherry creek area. Taken families here and they have loved it as well. Lots of options. Simple but good. Definitely recommend this place to anyone We ate here for brunch. Coffee was yummy. Chicken n waffles were ok but the true show stealer was Drew. Such an amazing waiter! Attentive and genuinely fun"

    "reviews": "My first visit to the Cherry Cricket was overall very pleasant. The crowd wasn\u2019t overwhelming, and since I went solo, my food arrived pretty quickly. It was a great casual dining experience with a welcoming vibe.\n\nMy only gripe\u2014and the reason I\u2019m not giving five stars\u2014is the pricing. The food is on the expensive side. Keep in mind that this place is semi \u00e0 la carte: you\u2019re paying $14\u2013$17 just for the burger, and fries, and other sides, are sold separately. For that price, I can find other spots where an entire meal\u2014including dessert\u2014costs the same or even less. And I paid $40 for a burger, fries, and a slice of cake.\n\nThat said, I understand that the Cherry Cricket is a long-standing Denver staple with a loyal following, and I respect that. Will I be back? Yes, but only occasionally. While I enjoyed the visit, the higher prices make it more of a once-in-a-while treat than a regular go-to for me, especially with less costly alternatives. Fun bar atmosphere that reminds you of a classic dive, but elevated feel. The food was good. We got burgers and a basket of fries. You can petty much get a burger anyway you want here, or choose from one of their specialty burgers. The service is a little slow even though it was not busy, but on the other hand you do not feel rushed. Very fun place to stop in Cherry Creek! Our burgers and food were great. Our server Birdie took great care of us and kept us feeling well attended at all times. The drink selection was a great variety of choice and lots of local brews. Forgot to get a better picture of the food because we were ready to scarf it down. I used to come here every month when we lived close by. Just stopped in during a visit and it\u2019s still a great place to get a burger and a beer. Located in a classy neighborhood, but it\u2019s straight up old school in the best way. Already looking forward to another visit, hopefully soon! Cherry Cricket in Cherry Creek is hands-down one of the best dining experiences I\u2019ve had in Denver\u2014and I\u2019m not saying that lightly. From the moment I walked in, I felt like I was in for something special, and the team here absolutely delivered in every way possible.\n\nLet\u2019s start with the food. I ordered the Cricket Royale Burger, and wow\u2014this thing is a masterpiece. Juicy, flavorful, and perfectly cooked, with all the toppings balanced just right. You can tell the kitchen takes pride in their craft because every bite was next-level. It\u2019s one of those burgers that immediately makes it into your personal hall of fame. Alongside it, I went with the Pretzel Sticks & Queso, which were the ideal starter. The pretzels were warm, soft, and just salty enough, and the queso? Creamy, rich, and addictive. I actually considered ordering a second round of the pretzels just to keep dipping.\n\nTo wash it all down, I had a WeldWerks Juicy Bits Hazy IPA, which was the perfect pairing. Hoppy, refreshing, and full of flavor without being overpowering\u2014it complemented the meal beautifully. If you\u2019re into craft beer, Cherry Cricket has a great selection, but that WeldWerks Hazy IPA is an absolute gem.\n\nBut let me tell you\u2014the food, as amazing as it is, isn\u2019t the only reason I\u2019ll be coming back. The staff here truly made the experience unforgettable.\n\nFirst, I have to give a major shoutout to Gage, my server. Gage was absolutely incredible from start to finish. Friendly, attentive, knowledgeable, and just genuinely enjoyable to talk to. He gave perfect recommendations, checked in at just the right times without hovering, and made me feel like I was a regular even though it was my first visit. Servers like Gage are rare. He\u2019s the kind of person who turns a good meal into a great memory\u2014and frankly, he\u2019s the reason I\u2019ll be coming back again and again. Every restaurant needs a Gage!\n\nTo top it off, Will the manager came by my table just to check in and see how everything was going. That kind of personalized attention from management is so rare these days, and it honestly made my night. Will was welcoming, professional, and clearly takes pride in running a great establishment. You can feel the positive energy throughout the restaurant, and I think that starts with great leadership like his.\n\nThe vibe in Cherry Cricket Cherry Creek is super inviting. Whether you\u2019re out for a solo dinner, a casual date, or a fun night with friends, the space is welcoming and the atmosphere hits that perfect balance between lively and laid-back. It\u2019s exactly the kind of spot you want to keep in your regular rotation.\n\nSo, if you\u2019re in Denver\u2014whether you\u2019re a local or just passing through\u2014do yourself a favor and stop by Cherry Cricket in Cherry Creek. Get the Cricket Royale Burger, grab the pretzels and queso, order a WeldWerks Juicy Bits, and ask for Gage. You won\u2019t regret it.\n\nThis place has absolutely earned its five stars, and I genuinely can\u2019t wait to come back. Bravo to the whole team!"

First, I only went because I didn\u2019t want to go hang out at West Elm while my better half shopped and I assumed it was a Wisconsin bar since it was named Milwaukee St Tavern (I\u2019m bad at knowing street names) It wasn\u2019t a Wisconsin bar, but it was a great place.\n\nBartenders were super nice. Wish they would\u2019ve had Fat Tire on tap or a malty beer like an Oktoberfest, but they still had bottles of beer I enjoyed.\n\nBurger was great, steak was good. And it was very well priced for being in Cherry Creek.\n\nFinally, getting to the restroom was a bit of a maze, but they were well lit, had outdated posters and good mirrors for a selfie. So, it felt like a dive bar restroom, which is the best kind of restroom to snap a mirror selfie in and let people know you\u2019re out on the town for the night."

Amazing from Caesar salad all the way to the outstanding Bread Pudding. I would drive to Denver for this Bread pudding alone.  My husband doesn\u2019t care for desserts, it\u2019s always my choice.   It was the best dessert he\u2019s ever had.   His words.\nAnd for him to compliment a steak\u2026 is huge. Went to Del Frisco rooftop to enjoy the nice weather. Umbrella's were poorly positioned and completely ineffective (you will sit in the full sun) but maybe the umbrella's are mainly to keep the bar staff cool.\nStaff was slow and had to wait a long time for someone to give us menus and water.\nOrdered the branzino and the salad was old, clearly yellow lettuce leaves and wilted. We had such a great time last night at Del Frisco Grill in Cherry Creek. I am only sorry that I don't remember my server's name. She was absolutely incredible! Wonderful place! Everything was amazing. Garage parking that they will validate. 10/10 recommend! The food was fabulous, the service (entire wait staff) was exemplary (no rush between appetizers, salads and meal). We will definitely return. Thanks so much for a wonderful dining experience!"

    "reviews": "A great spot for happy hour in Cherry Creek. Happy hour is from 2pm-6pm and margs are $8 and tacos are $3. They have delicious and creative homemade corn tortillas with flavors like hibiscus and squid ink. Highly recommend sitting outside on their large patio! Machete Tequila and Tacos is definitely a spot worth visiting if you\u2019re a fan of authentic and flavorful tacos. We tried the Al Pastor, Arrachera, and Tripas tacos, and they were absolutely amazing\u2014well-seasoned, perfectly cooked, and packed with flavor. The Lengua tacos were decent, but I probably wouldn\u2019t order them again as they didn\u2019t stand out compared to the others.\n\nTo start, we had the salsa and guacamole, which were fresh and a great way to kick off the meal. For drinks, I had the Sayulita cocktail, which had a nice kick from the muddled habanero\u2014spicy but well-balanced. My husband ordered the Oaxaca cocktail, which he enjoyed.\n\nOverall, Machete Tequila and Tacos delivers on bold flavors and quality ingredients. If you\u2019re looking for a great taco spot with creative cocktails, this place is worth checking out! Great place for big parties and strong drinks! Definitely recommend if you're looking to eat good food and drink on a budget. Vibes are amazing and service was even better. Great spot for tasty tacos and good margaritas. I only wish we had more time in Denver to try the full menu. The lively vibe made the visit even better. Killer tacos. I loved the tortillas on my street tacos. I ordered the Campechano which was lovely. I am a taco snob and this landed beautifully for me. I would have like more heat out of the salsas but I\u2019m a bit crazy when it comes to spice level."

    "reviews": "Great place for food and drinks especially when the weather is nice enough to sit out. They do have a few fireplaces for cooler weather though. The Philly cheesesteak is very good as is the Cubano sandwich.\n\nService is very good. Order at the counter and pick up your food when the buzzer they give you goes off. The space is open air with some tables under cover. Parking can be problematic at busy times, but is often available close to the beer garden. This was a hidden gem of a sandwich spot we used to come by all the time when we had a Wings of the Rockies membership. The cubano and pulled pork are still my faves. Chicken nuggets are freshly made and very well seasoned. My daughter loves the pretzel. I honestly think this is a very well designed and incredibly efficient spot perfect for bigger groups. The beer on tap choices are excellent local spots. Fun place to drink and have a bite! We got the sweet potato fries to munch on before dinner plans and they were so good paired with the chipotle mayo! The Chile Guava cider was delicious as well. The staff are so kind and the atmosphere is unbeatable on a nice sunny day. The Lowry Beer Garden is a great place to spend a summer evening with friends. The outdoor seating area is spacious and comfortable, and there is a wide variety of beer to choose from. The food is also good.\n\nThe service can be a bit slow at times, but overall I had a positive experience at the Lowry Beer Garden. I would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a fun and relaxing place to hang out with friends.\n\nThis place is dog friendly! Easy to get to and parking is a little hectic. It is a beautiful place to bring your family on a nice day.  Easy to order your drinks and food at the counter. Food was good."

My daughter had the burger. I literally looked away for about 3 minutes and the burger was GONE off her plate. I asked her if she inhaled it\u2026 she grinned and said \u201cman that was sure good.\u201d Don\u2019t miss this spot\u2026 a treat for the whole family. Very welcoming service. The double cheeseburger was delicious. A very good variety of beers. Even the restrooms were impeccable. A very nice experience My partner and I love going to breweries when we travel to other states. We got a couple drinks each and it was nice and crisp. Prices were reasonable. Bartender was always attentive and friendly. Will be returning on our next trip to Denver. We went to Denver Beer Co. in Lowry today, and we loved our time there.\n\nNumber 1: this place is extremely family-friendly. The playground right next to the beer garden is fantastic. We had a hard time prying our daughter away from it.\n\nNumber 2: the beers were great, and the food was delicious. Our service was good, although the food took a bit longer than expected. It was pretty busy, so it's understandable. Our servers were quick and friendly, though.\n\nNote, finding parking might be challenging. There's only a small parking lot; it's mostly street parking around the park where this restaurant/brewery is located.\n\nWe definitely enjoyed our time, and we'll be back! I love this place honestly, the atmosphere, the people, beers, events, but what I love most about this place and what I can go to every week is for the cheeseburger. I've tried many burgers but none compare to this place. The best burger I have ever eaten and I believe there is no other like it. In general I love this place and all the food is very good, if you had more TVs to watch sports it would be incredible."

The food is delicious whether you get breakfast or lunch and the extraordinary customer service staff is the best! A huge thanks to Stephanie who\u2019s friendly , thoughtful, professional and so fast at getting our food and Cynthia is fabulous and makes sure all goes well! We highly recommend this place for your best dining experience ! This place was not very good. Was disappointed because the reviews were great but I think because it\u2019s a golf course, it\u2019s a members get special treatment kind of thing. I sat in front of the bar and ordered a Bloody Mary. I got a half pour of vodka in a very basic Bloody Mary. Meanwhile members come in and are getting double pours.\nAs far  as food goes, I ordered the Greek salmon salad. It was a great salad but the salmon looked as though it had been sitting out for days and was way over salted. It was the worst piece of salmon I\u2019ve ever seen. I did not eat it.\nThe breakfast burrito was decent. It was not well proportioned though. Half was potato and chorizo while the other half was egg. The green chili had no spice at all and almost tasted as if it was out of a can. Will not be returning. Great little bar and grill at the Golf Course. Friendly staff with a large variety of food and drinks.\n\nIt was great chatting with Barbra, and had a delicious and hearty French Dip & salad.\n\nQuite a few beers on draft as well as bottles and mixed drinks.\n\nWasn't the cheapest place but it was reasonable for a golf course.\n\nCould probably use a differently colored carpet but otherwise had a great experience! Thanks! Seemed very loud. But not complaining.. food good. Tad pricy but it's golf! No the best place for breakfast. High priced for what you get. Maybe there's a discount for regulars."

Be aware that they may have cooked the food a long time in advance before serving it to you. Friend took me to this place and it was fantastic. There were ton of delivery orders coming in. The waitress was super friendly and patient with me as I was indecisive. The food was absolutely delicious and the servings were huge. The spice level was perfect.  I'll be returning to try more items. This place was not good for me. I ordered chicken curry fried rice. It was a very small portion for $13+$2 tip for carry out. It was dry and flavorless lacking quality. It was quick and hot and the guy was very nice that took my order. I didn't eat very much before tossing it away. The food missed the mark. I had high hopes only to be met with disappointment. The inside was very outdated. Didn't seem very clean and way over priced. FANTASTIC Chinese restaurant. It's not a large chain. Fresh ingredients and a very tasty menu. Staff is quick, efficient, and friendly. Portion sizes are correct, and tables and chairs are comfortable. It's a nice place to spend lunch. I just moved to the area this week and wasn't feeling making dinner. I've been wanting to try East China, and tonight was the night! I ordered pickup via Doordash, and while it took a little longer than I anticipated for it to be ready, it is DEFINITELY worth the wait!\nMy chicken pad Thai could ONLY be improved by being spicier (I'll note that in my order next time). The Thai tea with brown sugar Boba is PERFECTION.\nHoly COW, I am blown away, and I will be back regularly! Thank you, ladies & gents!"

The beer is great i recommended the direct diezel. The bartenders are great. They have an outdoor barn . They are pet friendly. 6 and 40 Brewery, located at 883 Parfet St. Unit J in Lakewood, Colorado, is a family-owned, car-themed brewery that offers a delightful selection of handcrafted ales and seltzers.  \ufffc\n\nThe taproom\u2019s classic 1960s auto and muscle car decor creates a cozy and unique atmosphere, making it a perfect spot for both car enthusiasts and beer lovers.  \ufffc\n\nTheir diverse beer lineup caters to a wide range of tastes.\n\nFor those who appreciate robust flavors, the \u201c300KPH Baltic Porter\u201d (6.9% ABV) and the \u201cBadillac Oatmeal Stout\u201d (6.0% ABV) are excellent choices.\n\nIf you prefer lighter options, the \u201cMow-bi Lawn Kenobi Kolsch\u201d (6.4% ABV) and the \u201c55 Speedster Munich Helles\u201d (5.4% ABV) are refreshing and satisfying.  \ufffc\n\nThe brewery\u2019s commitment to quality and creativity is evident in each pour, and their friendly staff enhances the overall experience.\n\nWhether you\u2019re a local or just passing through, 6 and 40 Brewery is a must-visit destination for a memorable craft beer experience in Lakewood. Despite being in an industrial park, 6 and 40 is a classic neighborhood brewery.  There brewers come up with truly unique beer (Sake beer with lemon anyone?).

We had a great server...knowledgeable about the beers and even the brewery industry in general. One of the owners popped in to talk about two new releases and the festivities planned for their 3 year celebration.  Fun. Will definitely visit again."

We tried the gluten free too and it was one of the best in Denver! Plus I was seriously impressed just watching them in the kitchen churn out beautiful pizzas. Would highly recommend to anyone. Don\u2019t forget to add on the homemade ranch, might be the best I\u2019ve ever had. Super solid pizza joint that should not be overlooked.  I had carry out here, so didn\u2019t get a ton of pictures, but the taste definately delivered.\n\nI personally think 1 large pizza will fill up 2 hungry people and that\u2019s it.  Keep that in mind when considering price and ordering for a large group.\n\nThe pizza is still expensive, but more reasonable than some other places for a less great product.  I\u2019ll be coming back if I ever want thin crust! Best NY pizza in town, hands down. They are using high quality ingredients: oyster mushrooms, cupping pepperoni, Kalamata olives, and the sausage has a flavor unlike whatever other store are using. The crust is crispy all the way through; no flop.\nIt\u2019s a very unsuspecting location but what they\u2019re doing here is nothing short of a public service. PZA is my new go to spot I\u2019m a native who always complains about the pizza scene in Denver being bad (it is). PZA is here to save the day! By far the best pizza in town. Killa Bee goes unbelievably hard.\n\nThis is the type of restaurant we need to support. No frills. Just great food. Go check them out. This place is legit! Great crust, really good toppings, excellent red sauce and very tasty white pies. It\u2019s a small place, making each pie with care and attention to detail. That takes a little extra time - anyone complaining about wait times, get over it! Want something quick, go to Cosmos. Want something that\u2019s actually GOOD, something even this former East coaster and acknowledged pizza snob deems worthy? Come to PZA. It\u2019s one of only a few places in the city I legitimately love for pizza. So, so good!"

Prices are great and the service is excellent ,\nyou need to support a local brewery like this one . Parking was difficult to find (obviously it's Denver) Ambiance was great, I love the little patio. The bartender was short with us and couldn't answer any of our beer questions. We purchased a 750ml bottle and a 12 oz bottle. The Bartender poured our drinks for us but my husband and I were given equal amounts and she didn't give us the rest of the 750ml bottle when I asked. Very frustrating to feel ripped off. I would say third time is a charm for Renegade Brewing. The products being sold are world class along with the staffing.

Atmosphere was amazing and so were the people we met from the owners to the regulars. Our server was nice (I wish I remembered her name) and the food was really good. You HAVE to try the buffalo chicken rolls. 10/10. We will definitely be back if we are in Denver again. Thanks for a great time! As a newcomer to the neighborhood, I've been incredibly lucky to discover The Fainting Goat over the past month. It's quickly become my go-to spot, and that's largely thanks to the fantastic staff. I wanted to specifically call out a few people who have consistently made my experience exceptional:\n\n* **Brennen:** Brennen's knowledge of the drinks menu is impressive. He always offers great suggestions and is incredibly friendly, making every visit feel welcoming.\n\n* **Clair:** Clair is a true professional. Her efficiency and positive attitude are infectious, and she always manages to keep the bar running smoothly, even when it's busy.\n\n* **Jenna:** Jenna has a knack for remembering regulars' orders, and she always greets everyone with a warm smile. Her attentiveness and friendly service are top-notch.\n\n* **Mia:** Mia's personality is so vibrant and engaging. She creates a fun atmosphere, and always makes sure everyone feels included.\n\nThe Fainting Goat itself has a great atmosphere, but the staff truly elevates the experience.  However, if I had to offer one negative note, it would be that the prices for alcoholic beverages are a bit steep.  I highly recommend checking it out! I love this place, the best pickle shots, drinks at the best price and the staff is actually nice af! Hell ya Fainting Goat Pub! Great environment. Fun times playing darts too \ud83e\udef6\ud83c\udffb Food was pretty good! Nicer quality pub food than mostly anywhere I\u2019ve been.\n\nThe few floors are really nice, too. The outdoor possibility is awesome.\n\nJust one thing that threw me way off. I was there a few weeks ago for an event, and when it was time for everyone to home, one of the employees was pushing us out, and specifically saying that \u201cgo home and shoot a porno, it\u2019s time to go home.\u201d That is verbatim what he said. Tall white guy with a beard, the employee was. Strange to say the least.\n\nNice all around but maybe get more normal, less out of line employees Didn\u2019t have food this time but love their potato skins and chicken sandwich. Chill bar seating as well as a roof and extra seating upstairs. Overall an easy pub with friendly staff."

And the chicken wings came out about 3 minutes after ordering, it was nuts. So we crushed those and then ordered another set of boneless to go. They have quite the variety of sauces. I wish the guy would\u2019ve just told me what is the single most popular sauce. I wasn\u2019t a fan of the flavor I got. Wasn\u2019t bad but not exactly my style. It was honey sriracha something or other. And the Nashville hot was pretty bland as well. They\u2019re bound to have a good sauce outta the 20 they had but I didn\u2019t discover it. Came to watch the nuggets game with my girl. Good atmosphere, friendly staff and good food. The 25oz drafts however are a ripoff. The cups barely fit my second 19.2oz can which poured to the exact same size as the first draft that came in the cup. Ain't no way those cups are 25oz. I never really complain about drinks but that's an obvious ripoff. As a local beer enthusiast I was disappointed since half of the giant amount of guests partook in the \"25oz\" drafts. Do better guys. This place is needed for our community. From the workers that welcome you with care to the food that is being serve for you. First time I tried this food was from Uber eats, and the food was so good i needed to try it in person to verify it wasn't a fluke. The first time I went in person I was blessed with the presence of Dylan, Bartender/the only person taking care of everyone at the moment, the experience was unique. This individual made sure that with more than 15 people in the restaurant, everyone felt like they were serve with kindness and love. The second time I went in person I got the opportunity to be greeted by Magdalena. This time I knew this place was amazing for sure. Even though it was crowded, the care i receive from this person was unique, felt like i knew them forever. Im glad this place is so amazing. Food order that is ok the picture are the following: Wings flavored with Lemon pepper and Bison Burger. Amazing every time and forgot to take further picture of how good the good is. The boneless wings are killer. Tons of TVs fair prices for beers. Great sports bar downtown. You can hear the games! Decent spot to watch sports. Plenty of TVs, although the big projector in the bar could use some brightness and color correction.\n\nSausage plate was a nice selection, wings were decent but not amazing. The servers were super nice, but it's got a weird system where you have order and pay through your phone.\n\nGo nuggets!"

I had so much fun that night singing around the piano!!\n\nDrinks were great and the sampler we ordered was also delicious !!\n\nParking is available just next to the entrance!!\n\nPrices are great!!! One man ordered my food. Another dropped it off. Never was talked to again after that. I had to go to the bar to get another drink. And after watch the first man who took my order sit (literally in a chair) and talk with customers I decided I could drink elsewhere. Them when I asked the second man for my check he brought it without the drink had ordered at the bar and had to ask for it to be added to my tab to make sure I paid for it. Food was great everything else was less than mid. PARKING - has a designated alley that has a few parking spots.\n\nAMBIANCE - Cute little spot that I see can accommodate different ambiances. Outside can be more sports bar like. Inside could feel like a pub or even like a romantic restaurant lounge. I think it depends on what's going on that day/night. We came in for a Sunday dinner and they had a piano player. You can tell there are regulars because the pianist took requests and played songs to sing to. Very nice.\n\nFOOD - I only got the spinach artichoke dip because I wasn't too hungry, but it was decent. Garlic seemed a little too raw, but it was alright. Drinks were really good though! Had a great time late night at Charlie Brown\u2019s! With Katana playing the piano we belted out some of our favorite songs (some weren\u2019t even on the list).

I've been here a billion times and haven't left a review.  This is egregious and I'm now rectifying this situation.  Great local \"dive bar\".  Food is so much better than you think it will be.   Get the sliders and the dips. Trust me.  The staff is wonderful.  Bartenders Jake, Spencer, James, Anna, Paige, Shane will take great care of you.  And don\u2019t forget Eagle superfan Jesse. and Jessie!\nIt's a Bonnano concept so you know you'll have a good time. One of the top 5 bars in Denver, in my opinion. The staff is on point every time, the prices are very fair, and the cheap beer selection is great! Food is really solid and served late which is really appreciated. Thanks Vesper!!! Vesper lounge is a great local spot with one of the best burgers and burger deal in Denver. You can get a burger, fries, and a beer for $12 on Sundays. They have apple spritz on tap and it's delicious. All of their food is fantastic and the staff is pretty great. I keep giving this place chances. Time and time again it\u2019s just really bad service. Our food was dying in the window. Cook didn\u2019t ring the bell except for one time. They watched it sit in the window for a while and never rang the bell again to let our server or anyone know food was up\u2026 Just no care at all. After we finally got our food, our server asked how everything was. We told her it was cold and she seemed upset with us after expressing how we felt. This will be the last time though unfortunately."

    "reviews": "Ordered food for takeout, we ordered the Black & Bleu burger and hickory burger with sweet potato fries, we also ordered the Mac & Cheese with garlic bread and for dessert their churro and ice cream. The food was delicious, burgers were cooked just right and looks to be a popular place, nice location and pleasant atmosphere inside. Will have to come and actually sit down and eat and have a drink the next time. Overall good experience and will definitely try this place again, nice that it\u2019s only down the street from where I have an apartment. If you\u2019re in the neighborhood and looking for something different this place is it. Atmosphere was definitely eclectic. It was very clean and the food was fantastic. Toys and drinks. Also good options staff was friendly. They came out fairly quickly with the portions. Bathrooms were a bit odd. Plenty of seating for the outside. It was a fairly large place with definitely seating for large groups. Even though it wasn\u2019t my style it is a great place to check out. The truffle fries and fried pickles were both great choices. We had their apple cider. Also which game called and was great. It was an empty Monday when I came. The made to order mac and cheese was everything I wanted and needed! The drinks were good. The staff was friendly, and the vibes immaculate. This might be my new favorite bar. A really cool local dive bar with a unique atmosphere, cool bartender, and great service and food for a reasonable price. Awesome pickle shots too!!! This bar is a cap hill gem!  Their burgers and truffle fries are to die for!  The vibes here on point with friendly and attentive staff! I always bring my friends here and they love it!\n\nThey have an awesome deal on the weekends for bottomless mimosas & brunch!\n\nLove the hybrid patio!\n\nThank you Butch for creating such a special place!"

    "reviews": "We found this place to stop for dinner driving through, and we were not disappointed!! Great service! Our Bartender Veronica was so sweet and very prompt on service! I ordered the Asian Crunch Salad and my boyfriend got the Shaved Prime Rib Dip. Both dishes were absolutely delicious.  For dessert we got the Banana Bar.\n\nThe atmosphere of this place is very chill and the decor is so cool! The Converse wall was probably my favorite!\n\nHighly recommend if you're in the area looking for a bite to eat!!! I wish i could have tried one of everything on the menu!!! Keep up the great work and delectable foods Culinary Dropout!!! Another amazing looking restaurant. The location is good, the decor is good, the food looks really good, the food looks better than it tastes.\n\nCulinary drop out feels like they've optimized for Instagram photos and ignored how the food actually tastes.\n\nA friend ordered the grilled cheese but couldn't find the cheese on the sandwich. The sandwich looks amazing, tastes mediocre.\n\nMy fried chicken looked great. The chicken was fried at too low of a temperature and was soggy with oil. The breast meat I ended up leaving after only a few bites.\n\nAnother friend got a salad after her pizza was dropped on the floor by staff. The salad looked really good and seemed to have all the right ingredients. The entire table agreed it didn't taste that great.\n\nTwo other friends got the breakfast burrito and said it was \"fine\".\n\nPlease do better culinary drop out, maybe go back and finish your degree? This was a great experience. The food was great all around. I was not all that fond of Brussels sprouts appetizer as it was drowned in sauce. The cole slaw was a bit tart for my taste. The ribs were great and the fried chicken was really really good! Went here because it was a scratch kitchen, this place is amazing! It was a short wait for a table but worth it! We got the Mongolian short rib and cacio e Pepe, both were amazing. The drinks are well made and delicious! Definitely coming back. Went here because the on-line menu listed Peking Duck and Shrimp Fried Rice, but that wasn't on the menu today. The brunch hash I chose was okay. The pork tasted good, but had a little more fat than I wanted/needed. I'd go with something else next time.\n\nService was excellent both from the hostess and the server. Both were prompt, polite and efficient. The space itself is very interesting. Lots of televisions showing sports and very large. For the number of people dining, it wasn't as noisy as expected. Apparently they have live music at times.\n\nParking is an issue. There isn't a parking lot and on street parking can be hard to come by. I ended up about 3 blocks away in one of only a few spots that close."

    "reviews": "Very good coffee and a large selection of interesting teas including some loose leaf teas on their tea wall such as the peach ginger loose leaf black tea. Some pastries, empanadas and quiches. The bacon cheddar quiche is outstanding.\n\nService is excellent. The space is comfortable and pleasant, but can be full at peak times. They do have Wi-Fi (password posted near where you order) and some people sit and use laptops or iPad so turnover of tables is not necessarily fast. However, they do encourage table sharing so you can usually find a spot.\n\nParking can be problematic at peak times. I ended up about 2.5 blocks away but was glad that I stopped in. Love this place. Great vibe. Classic decor- no cookie cutter subway tile, loud paint and crazy graphics. Surprisingly broad menu of beverages (teas, coffees, bottles and wine) plus fresh sweet and savory items. Honestly, such a great find! Ca Cafe Kochi has a super cozy and chill vibe. The coffee was really good (I had the Kochi latte \u2014 loved it), and the desserts were as beautiful as they were tasty. The staff was friendly but not overbearing, which I really appreciate. I\u2019ll definitely be coming back \u2014 it\u2019s perfect for a quiet break or getting some work done. Very cute cafe. I only ordered a cookie (Persian love cookie) and didn\u2019t try the drinks. The cookie was pretty good, but nothing amazing, hence the 4 stars. I would probably go back if I\u2019m ever in the area. Ordered a special drink (can\u2019t remember the name) but I do remember it supposed to have raspberry and vainilla. I was only able to taste the matcha not sure if they forgot to add the raspberry and vainilla, I didn\u2019t wanted to ask since I\u2019m a matcha fan so it was just fine. Their empanadas in my opinion are a bit pricy and too small. Other than that great place to visit"

I also got the pretzel with mustard and it was really good especially since there\u2019s not a full kitchen. Will be coming back! Love this spot, super cozy bar with friendly and knowledgeable bar staff and great drinks for decent prices. Came to watch the Nuggets and got the added joy of jamming to a playlist of mostly classic rock while we watched. We felt very welcomed as new-to-towners! I love this place so much! In terms of the overall aesthetic, it is lovely with its wooden interiors, exterior vines, and ample outdoor seating with a sofa!\n\nThe selection of beer is fantastic. There was a considerable variety with such different and unique tastes. The beer tastes better during trivia night. It gets crowded, but it is a popping time!\n\nHighly recommend! \ud83d\udc4d (5 time visit review) Bartenders know their beer. Zero questions. However they aren't the most friendly people. They weren't rude but they weren't welcoming. I just moved into the neighborhood and hope this changes. Congress Park Taproom is everything you want from a chill, relaxed sports bar. Service was great! Lots of recommendations. A couple different ciders to choose from. Mostly beer. Sports games playing on TVs. Light appetizers/pizza available. We didn\u2019t try either. Definitely recommend for a local, fun bar. Mango cider was delicious!!"

It's a quaint and small place, that I'd return to.\nPerhaps we'll return for food sometime. Generous drinks at a great price. Fantastic atmosphere and the bar tenders were top notch! We have a new favorite spot! Hopefully I get this right, but, Andrew (sorry if I misnamed you) cool guy with the beard was awesome (there were two both were great)! The guy who brought the hot sauce basket was top tier! Tacos were fire. Vibes were 100. 10/10! I came here 2022 and service was mediocre.\nI gave it another chance 2024 and JD changed my mind.\nNow I come once a week and everyone has great service.\nFood is all good.\nDrinks are good.\nNothing is overpriced.\nNot overcrowded.\nPerfect vibes. We have found our new favorite neighborhood bar! Small space, excellent service and they have daily specials. They also serve pretty amazing BBQ here, including other menu items. Several people have come in to get BBQ to-go during our visit, which prompted us to try it ---  Did not disappoint, YUM! They also have Bingo here weekly and a DJ on Saturdays which is pretty fun."

    "reviews": "You\u2019re probably not coming here for food and that\u2019s smart. But if you do, just know that if you ask for a chicken salad you\u2019re actually asking for a crouton salad with 2 bites of chicken in it for $15+ over shredded bagged iceberg. Eat before you come. Took that picture before the first bite. That\u2019s the large chicken Cesar. Aka the plain side salad anywhere else. Their bartenders are great, the atmosphere is great, and I\u2019m about to go get a second lunch somewhere else. I didn\u2019t want to dog on their ratings because I\u2019m unimpressed with a salad from a bar, just bothered me that I got this home to open it and find it to be so disappointing. I ordered \u201cextra crispy\u201d buffalo wings and some fries, but what I received was slimy and fatty. My lunch reminded me that \u201ccrispy\u201d usually is an interpretation. The fries here are battered style like Long John Silver\u2019s. I haven\u2019t regret a lunch more than this in a long time. I ended up peeling the flaccid skin (and thus the sauce) off the wings and eating the inside only. I did not ask for a revision, so blame me a bit. The wing sauce had a great flavor, but I won\u2019t be having it again.\n\nThe space is cool and the bartender was nice. The wings were just so, so off the mark. It\u2019s a classic Denver dive bar. You want sports? You got it, so many TV\u2019s. Great food? That too. Drinks are reasonable and service is friendly. Patio has TV\u2019s and a fire pit. No hassles, just chill vibes. Best kept secret near Park Hill! As a loyal customer of over two years, I have always had my REAL ID accepted without issue. However, today I was informed that my ID was no longer being accepted, and I was denied service. This experience is both disappointing and unacceptable, especially given my long-standing relationship with this  business.\n\nBefore coming in, I recommend bringing a second form of ID. Boys trip to Denver, saw the name, thought it was worth checking out. Got in immediately got denied at the bar because no one had the \"My Colorado App\", didn't know these Colorado natives hated outsiders that much. On a Saturday night at that. Claimed they had too many underage kids coming in, clearly a bad reputation. Everyone in the group was 25+ no one could even be mistaken as underage. Wouldn't recommend unless you're a grey-haired Colorado Native apparently. Still wouldn't have been worth it, bad atmosphere."

They have fantastic happy hour options, a vast wine selection, and food options for anyone. Plenty of indoor seating and a great patio area. Staff is friendly, service is quick. On a Monday & Tuesday there\u2019s a cool $25 bottle and board deal. Any other day the food probably isn\u2019t worth the price. Still very good for what it was. Wine selection is decent. Had pretty good service as well. We absolutely love this place! I have been here multiple times, and it did not disappoint once. We always try a few things, and are always happy with our picks! The atmosphere and service is great too, inside & outside! I have celiac and I think the chicken mozzarella might be one of the best Sammies I\u2019ve had since being gf!

    "reviews": "Quickly becoming a regular visit for us!\nExcellent food, I've tried many dishes and haven't had anything I don't like yet. Really enjoy the lasagna, pasta with sauce, and the  bolognese! The salads topped with shrimp or salmon are also very tasty, a nice light meal that doesn't weigh me down but also fills me up.\nGood service as well, very attentive waiters and waitresses. If it's a weekend it's not a bad idea to make a reservation for prime hours. Although I have never had issue with walking in and just getting a table especially during happy hour. They stay fairly busy but usually you can get in fairly quick.\n\nGood selection of beer and wines, as well as the quality liquors. Whiskey and bourbon are my favorites and it's nice to see 4 roses bourbon on a happy hour special. It's pretty good bourbon for the price. It\u2019s such a cute cozy spot. Extremely friendly welcoming staff.\n\nI had sweet potatoes shells and they were divine. You can tell when pasta dishes are made from scratch and extremely fresh. The red sauce was incredible(not from can), It brought childhood tomato memories. I also had a bite of lasagna and it definitely exceeded my expectations. It had all the classical layers with multiple types of cheese, and was definitely worth the calories. I\u2019m not a cannoli expert, but I\u2019d go for  jog again to have another one. They have a great happy hour and even half a salad or half pasta are great solid European full portion meals.\n\nGive it a try- you won\u2019t be disappointed. Everything made from scratch, extremely fresh and tender. Shells and Sauce is a fantastic neighborhood spot with a cozy atmosphere and excellent service. From the moment we walked in, the staff was welcoming and attentive. Our server was especially great\u2014knowledgeable, friendly, and spot-on with recommendations.\n\nThe dishes were outstanding, with fresh ingredients and rich flavors. Every bite felt carefully crafted, and you could tell they put love into their food. The cocktails were just as impressive\u2014well-balanced, creative, and the perfect complement to our meal.\n\nOverall, a wonderful dining experience. Whether you\u2019re in the mood for comforting Italian food or a great drink, this place delivers. Can\u2019t wait to return! As an Italian with high standards, I can't WAIT to come back here! The seafood diavolo is incredible, as is the complimentary bread/oil they bring. Spring for dessert, it's worth it. Great wine selection and great cozy atmosphere! My girlfriend and I were on the search for a great Italian restaurant for a date night, and we found that with Shells and Sauce. Shells and Sauce is located in a nice neighborhood (Congress Park) and had parking in the back of the building. The staff was very friendly and also did a great job listing all the daily specials.\n\nThe food was a real stand out, from the free bread that arrives to the table, to each of the wonderful entrees we tried. The truffle mac was a good appetizer, but the stuffed shells were the real star. The sweet potato shells paired with the pesto sauce were creamy and delicious. I would highly recommend Shells and Sauce for your next date night!"

    "reviews": "Nice restaurant in a neighborhood strip mall which seems to be popular. The menu includes some interesting choices. The French onion soup is good and a cup can be chosen as a side for a small extra charge. It was well worth it. The adult grilled cheese is different and very good. The pear and onions go well with the cheese. I'm glad  I didn't add the optional bacon though.\n\nService was very good here - fast and friendly. The space was a little dark if you were seated away from the windows, but not too dark. There are a few screens around the room showing varied programming without sound. They do have password protected Wi-Fi for guests.\n\nParking is available in a lot shared by the businesses in the strip mall and can be fairly full at mealtimes. The staff is incredible. Food is incredible. Their margaritas are the absolute best in town! It is so welcoming and warm and laid back. Total hidden gem!! I hesitate writing this review because I don\u2019t want to lose our regular table ;) Chef Jonathan is an A+ human and Autumn is our favorite server ever. GO TO HERE! Bertha's is seriously my favorite brunch spot in town. I skip any of the popular brunch places and take my out-of-town guests here. It is family friendly and also just chill. I've seen the same staff since I started going so it must be a decent place to work, too. Sincere gem in the neighborhood! Every food item I've tried has been delicious!! We come here weekly. Best margarita in Denver. Everything is made from scratch. The absolute best neighborhood spot. We eat all over the country and it\u2019s something we crave. Fantastic staff. Great food. Amazing value. Loved this place! The service was amazing. I highly suggest sitting at the bar for a good time. Our bartender Bailey was amazing. She was fast and friendly. I ordered the chicken tenders appetizer but it was enough food to be a main course. My grandmother got the chrispy chicken salad that was also really good. The happy hour has really great prices. $9 Margaritas were great. Plenty of parking here too."

The only plus that I can see is there is a smoking patio. If you're looking for a hookup, this is probably the place to go and I'm not talking about girls Great music! Great ambiance! Had a good time! Friday nite but got there too late for  catfish...it's 5 pm thru 8 pm, if anyone wants to know! We ended up going to Fat Boys for fried catfish! Steph's a great bartender. Quaint dive bar. Good vibes. Awesome prices I popped into this bar called sports station to watch game 6 of the Nuggets versus Timberwolves. While it's called sports station, there were only two, maybe three small old TVs. There was a projector playing on to a wall with no screen and it wasn't very bright. While I was there for about 5 minutes to bartender didn't bother talking to me or offering me a drink. She was busy dealing with somebody complaining that while half the bar was watching the game he didn't want to hear it, so she turns it off, claiming she was trying to please everybody. I don't see the point of being in Denver watching the Denver Nuggets and game 6 and not having the game fully on. I left and I overheard the bartender say something like, C, that guy's leaving because of this. It was also warm in there. Not sure if the AC was broken but there were definitely fans going. Is definitely a very old bar for old people who don't care too much about their environment. Little bit sad honestly, but I get what people go there. Just not what I wanted or needed and just not a very good atmosphere overall Friendly patrons, staff.  No kitchen but frozen pizza l, nuts, and jerky.  Bartender was very accommodating and kind"

    "reviews": "I ordered a burger a few days ago and I was telling my son how good it was. So we ordered separately for takeout tonight. We ordered the 9.99 deal and we both ordered bacon cheeseburgers. Mine came with bacon, his did not. I'm attaching pictures of both burgers and his receipt and mine so you can see that we are not making it up. Mine is the one without cheese. Also, mine had pink, ordered without, as you can see on my receipt. To make it worse, it was like a blizzard outside. I didn't realize that before I ordered. I narrowly avoided an accident and ran into the curb trying to avoid it. I even got stuck there for a few minutes due to that, but managed to get out. The last time I ordered there was a paper to give feedback on my order in the bag but this time there wasn't. So I'm doing it here. Love the new Cajun menu features \ud83d\ude0b  so good! Don't recommend it to people who don't like spicy food. Please keep the items on the menu \ud83d\ude06 I ate here last night 1-12-25 me and my girlfriend got the boneless wings and the meat was raw! I\u2019m going to be making a call to the health department and calling the store in the morning when open. I\u2019m NOT going to get sick over people that can\u2019t do a simple job. Went in for some wings and the Nuggets game. For the 4th time in the last 2 months they have not tossed the wings, merely dressed with sauce (which is a shame because the wings are usually fried well).\n\nHad to send it back again tonight, this time the chef came out and rudely explained that she makes them with \"lots of love\" when there is clearly a passive aggressive amount of sauce on the wings. She quickly back pedaled her comment as she saw I was getting up to leave.\n\nI feel bad for the bar tender, he's always nice, but the food and service from the chef tonight will stop me from returning again. The guy who brought out our food was chill however I ordered two burgers no pink\nThey both came pink had to come home and re cook my burgers"

    "reviews": "Waiting too long in the drive up and just left without my order. Taking way too long and I ended up being late for work. Also with the biggie bags, the meat and chicken has really shrunk in size. Don't do that. Keep the meat and chicken the same size and just charge more. I don't mind that but shrinking portion sizes just doesn't work for me. Won't be back. I'll just go a little further up the street to McDonald's. Most recent trip- Jr. Bacon cheeseburger came with no bacon, no tomatoes, no onion or pickles- how? And I foolishly attempted to customize a cheeseburger by adding lettuce and tomato. Instead I got a cheeseburger with literally zero toppings or sauces. Somehow they were out of chocolate frosty and gave me a disgusting caramel one without asking if that swap was ok. I wish I would\u2019ve noticed before I got home. Ordered a cheese baked potato for my fianc\u00e9, guess what no cheese just a plain potato. This location is the worst in Colorado. Every time here there\u2019s multiple issues. Never coming back. Fire everyone and sell the location to an owner that cares. What the menu shows vs the piddly little dried out chicken sandwich I got with one tiny sliver of lettuce and one little slice of tomato.\n\nWendys has really gone downhill. Their sandwiches that used to be great feel like dollar menu items now. The $3.50 burgers at Carl's Jr beat this sandwich. A qdoba burrito bowl is twice as much food for less than the price of this combo.\n\nUpdate: once again unimpressed when my $15 burger combo comes with three dried out value burger patties instead of the ones I paid for. Always seems to be pretty good experience at this particular Wendy's Girl that was cooking the burgers was very annoying and she kept saying she didn\u2019t give a shit about anybody or about customer service or any thing. Felt bad for the manager playing or not don\u2019t act like that in front of customers! SMH very immature tbh btw it was 9:53pm she had black hair n not in uniform UPDATE just got home 10:00 food is old as shit fries are cold and nuggets can clearly tell been sitting there for hours."

Tasty food and excellent service, today I went for lunch in the afternoon at this location and the young man who served me was friendly and the place was clean, you can see from the outside that the kitchen is kept clean which causes an impression that the food will be of good quality and it is! I politely asked the millennial wearing a big shiny cross to change his gloves after coughing into one of them. He gave me an attitude and refused to change both.\nHe then acted very passive aggressive and irritated because I didn't want to consume his germs, again I remained polite.\n\nI used to order delivery weekly from this restaurant, instead I'll remember the unsanitary pompous staff and go elsewhere. For being a store on the corner of Colfax & Wadsworth, this store tend to keep themselves clean and the riff-raff out.\n\nThe place is as expected from modernized Qdoba stores with all the yellow walls and such. However, they are quick in getting your food to you and the gentleman there was like a personal hype man. Much awesome. Normally this location does a great job. This go around, my veggie nachos were like soup. The liquid from the beans and veggies were not drained well at all, so it watered down the cheese way too much and the flavors weren\u2019t as good. The fajita veggies were chopped way too large for chips which normally isn\u2019t the case and the chips were overly salted. Unfortunately not worth finishing. I\u2019m hoping it was just an off day in the shop, but I felt it was worth writing a review so management can consider the feedback. Again, this is normally our go-to Qdoba, so not sure what\u2019s going on."

    "reviews": "Great location, great beer, and great pizza! You order at the bar and seat yourself in the spacious venue with views of Sloan's Lake.\n\nThe Cloudhead Hazy IPA was pretty darn solid, and the pizza was absolute perfection with its fluffy, chewy crust. The cheese and pesto were magnificent. The wings were meaty, and the Buffalo sauce brought just the right amount of heat. Be sure to grab an extra glass of water for that spice! However, I\u2019d recommend skipping the artichoke dip; it lacked the same flavorful vibe as the other dishes.\n\nLove the location next to the lake and parks. This is the ideal place to meet friends and family! There is something for everyone. Had a wonderful Sunday dinner on the rooftop patio overlooking Sloan\u2019s Lake. Their beer selection is great, I recommend getting a flight if you\u2019re into variety. Pizza is wonderful too, had the Hilltop and it was perfection. They also have a really nice and spacious indoor space both downstairs and upstairs off the rooftop. Will for sure be stopping back in next time we walk Sloan\u2019s Lake. Stopped by on our way from Aspen to Denver in the fall. It was perfect timing for their lunch special and we got a Margherita pizza. It paired perfectly with the beers. We were lucky and snagged a spot overlooking the lake. Fun place. I will be back to try more.\nWe popped for a quick drink and a snack. They have a good choice of beer, and I tried a seltzer (ok). We paired it with chicken wings and parmesan fries - both good, not a crazy amount flavor, rather on a \"safe\" side. Still, I want to try their cauliflower pizza one day.\nThe place itself is pretty big and very cool. We sat at the rooftop patio with a good view of Sloan Lake. BEST COFFEE STOUT EVER!!! You have to understand\u2026 coffee stouts are my favorite style of beer. Without fail, I order it anytime I find a brewery that has one. With that in mind, their Passerine Imperial Coffee Stout is probably the best coffee stout I\u2019ve ever had in my life. Please, for the love of all things good in this life, please keep this in rotation and consider making it part of your core brands \ud83d\ude4f"

    "reviews": "Probably a real hoot during Broncos games but pretty slow otherwise.\n\nMy steak tips were ok, didn't love the sauce. Kind of got a bit of a dive bar/sticky table feel, and surprisingly no local sports memorabilia in the place.\n\nStaff was super friendly and nice, and the atmosphere was fun with plenty of TVs for sports viewing. The staff are super friendly! I now go there on a regular basis. There is something for everyone on the menu, from special salads to Buffalo burgers to their signature dishes--all excellent! Not mention a full bar, a  huge patio and a private party room upstairs. They sometimes have live music. And they always have sports on multiple displays. I definitely recommend! Great service (Emily). Food was delivered quickly. We had 2 dishes: the Catalina sandwich was good but the cod plate was sub par. Small, flat fish portions and was over fried and dry. Clean bathroom. Located walking distance from the Broncos stadium. I ate here this past summer with my bestie before we visited Meow Wolf, which was located right up the street. The food was very good. However, the queso was just average. If you want to get an appetizer I would suggest trying a different one. The service was really great. I also loved the atmosphere of this restaurant. I would recommend, especially if you are visiting any of the nearby museums. If there isn\u2019t a broncos game then they\u2019re terrible, which sucks either way because who wants to dine close to the stadium on game day really except for visiting sad souls. I\u2019m a resident sad soul living next to this god forsaken stadium and sadly the nearest food is here. Venture a bit further if you want good food and somewhat good service outside of game days which is still a major deterrent. All in all they don\u2019t put actual effort in service or food quality unless the broncos are playing lol, prices per portion per service is not worth it. And I live up the block"

One of the best sours I\u2019ve had in a while. Decided to try a flight. The brewery is a delight. A small operation with big flavor and creativity. Put this at the top of your list. Amazing. A small bar area with friendly and helpful staff and always an interesting, unique and flavorful beer range (including some great Belgian Kriek & Farmhouse ales) - you need to try their flagship: Cherry Kriek. There's also other rooms, pinball machines and a biergarten. Very dog-friendly too. This place is top notch! Friendliest staff around and great beer. You can\u2019t go wrong. Followed one of our favorite food trucks (Nak'd Neck Chicken is amazing) and were happy to have some lovely beers to go with our dinner.\n\nNice small space, chill vibe and the flights we tried were delicious.\n\nI've seen some negative comments on their beers, feel free to IGNORE them. Each beer is a properly crafted example of the species, and well described on the menu... point is, if you order beer you don't like it's your fault, not the brewery. Don't like sweet beer then don't order cherry beer... Don't like hoppy beer don't order ipa...etc..."

    "reviews": "I absolutely love it here!! Jason and the other bartenders were so kind and friendly! Usually upscale cocktail lounges are a bit snooty, but not this place. The staff are giving dive bar, small town enegery while being in a very beautiful lounge. Cocktails are absolutely fantastic *chef's kiss* So our daughter was in town and we took her to Meow Wolf. We had been a few times, but it was her first experience. She was (of course) loving it. When she was done, we found one of the exit stairways (feels a bit like Ball Arena in there) and started down the stairs. We opened one of the doors, and thought we were just wandering into one of the displays.\n\nWe realize that they are serving real food and drinks, in a funky Meow Wolfy atmosphere and have a cocktail. We are mesmerized. We did not know this exhibit existed. We went back into the same door and down the stairs and out the building.\n\nWe were so excited. We asked a couple of friends who had been there before, and they didn\u2019t know about it. Sips With A Z. The legend started growing in our head.\n\nA couple of months later, we decided to go back to Meow Wolf and find this SipsWith A Z as our Fathers\u2019 Day treat.  Like little kids, we go to the information desk to ask for directions to this room. We haven\u2019t laughed so hard in a while. It is directly above the food court in the main lobby. Take the circular stairway up. It\u2019s right there. And we thought it was some secret hidden exhibit.\n\nIt is a hidden gem. The bartenders and manager are so awesome. Great drinks. Can be a little crowded at the bar, but everyone stays calm.\n\nThe best part that day was getting a high top table near that doorway entrance. We sat having drinks while confused people stumbled through the door - having the same experience we had with our daughter the first time.\n\nWe went again a few weeks ago with a small group of friends. We had a nice big booth and a couple of cocktails to get everyone ready for the exhibits.\n\nHighly recommend. Awesome place. Great bar tenders, just a bit limited in what they are allowed to serve; you can't get just a pour of something, must be in cocktail form.  Cocktails were good at least. The mixed drinks were not good. And then the bartender was pretty rude about it. Argh.  Do not recommend! Great to have a spot to take a rest between exploring with libations in a lounge atmosphere to recharge - I appreciated it more than the cafeteria atmosphere downstairs as this feels more upscale"

    "reviews": "What an absolute delight!!!  Not only top notch service, but a wonderful atmosphere.  The food was outstanding and we tried (and loved) things we hadn't tried before.  I would return here again and again without hesitation and I'm sure folks do.  We just happened upon it while visiting the Denver Mint and we enjoyed every moment of our experience!  Apparently they have the largest selection of single-malt whiskey in the world (outside of Scotland) and after seeing the BOOK of selections, I believe them!  And absolute must-try, and if you live close, make it a regular!  They deserve it! Excellent selection of single malt scotches. They have a mostly accurate little book divided by region for scotch, and I appreciate that.\n\nI only had their pilsner for a beer, but I think I'll try some more of their beer next time too. I knew about the whisky and came for that, I did not realize they brewed a lot of their own beer and have a couple cask ales. This place reminds me of Bull & Bush a lot (in a good way) but less \"sports bar\" and more actual British style pub (even upside down whiskey bottles for perfect pours).\n\nThe server was attentive and helped me make a couple first whisky selections by region. Even though my knowledge is plenty to find something I'd be after, it's nice to see the curated choices for certain regions.\n\nCheck 'em out! Busy for a reason. The food was great, I got the New World Fish and chips. Their house-made vinaigrette is very good, very basil-y. Guy at the bar had great whiskey recommendations. This place made being stuck in Denver worth it. I will definitely be back! Charming small place that puts forward fresh ideas in a traditional atmosphere.\n\nI got the esb and fish and chips. Esp is bitter, nutty and velvetey.\n\nFish and chips is salmon with fries and salad. Mine came with a comically large wedge of lemon that was almost bigger than the tiny filet of salmon I got which was cooked perfectly. Was also given to ke with an entire carafe of house-made vinaigrette, which was very delicious. Fries were alright.\n\nItd be nice to see some kind of dipper with the fish, like a dill tarter. Id rather eliminate the salad, or serve it as a side salad, and give a larger portion of salmon. I got too much of things I didnt really care for (massive lemon, large pile of salad, carafe of vinaigrette) and not enough of the meat and taters.\n\nAll in, service was great as well as the atmosphere and the food was good. We split a couple whiskeys (excellent recommendations from the server, by the way), a toasted sandwich, and a couple of their unique beers. Loved everything about this place. Only thing I wish they could have is a few bar stools for the full pub experience."

    "reviews": "Stopped here after visiting the Denver Art Museum. It exceeded my expectations! I got a simple meal- the specials which were a tomato basil grilled cheese and cup of chicken noodle soup and the side Cesar salad. The food came out quick and was super delicious! The service is also super friendly :) DO NOT DO THE ELF BAR!! This is a scam. They make you pay to get in by buying a ticket online.  Only get 90 minutes. When we got there, we had to wait in line and they still asked us to leave at our 90 minute even though we weren\u2019t here the full-time due to their long line ! You walk into a bar that has nothing to do with the elf. It looks like a Christmas bar. The menu has the names from the elf movie and so does the drink menu. They had a bingo and gave you a sucker for winning. Like what are we 5?! Plus, you had to order food and drinks plus tip your waiter. This was a total scam and a waste of money and a letdown. Why did we have to reserve a spot and pay for it?   The food was basic bar food nothing amazing. The fries were soggy. I don\u2019t drink so I have the fruit punch which was mostly ice and three marshmallows. Also half of the bar is on a patio, but you don\u2019t notice that unless you\u2019re sitting down and freezing they have it like a makeshift tent where it looks like it it\u2019s inside but it\u2019s really cold since it\u2019s Colorado.  Definitely save your money and go somewhere else. Cap City Tavern had one of the most fun Bingo Brunches I've ever had the pleasure of dining in. The Bingo Host Amy did a \"May the 4th be with you\" theme, and I never laughed and clapped and screamed so much during a meal. It was a good thing because the service was slow. The ABLT was delicious, but the green tea shot, not so much. I feel that more people should know about this place. Check them out when in Denver! DON'T EVER GO TO THE ELF BAR \"EVENT\"!!! The Elf Bar event at Cap City Tavern was, hands down, the worst Christmas pop-up event I have ever attended. We waited over 40 minutes for water (I had to go to the bar to get it), the drink we ordered was horrible (it was supposed to be a Christmas espresso martini, see photos), and we heard the announcement that we had to close out and leave within 10 minutes after having just been served our greasy food so the 8:30 group could arrive. I am absolutely perplexed as to why on earth this event would charge a fee, let alone a $15+ (per person) fee!!! Go anywhere - LITERALLY ANYWHERE - else to get free Christmas ambiance and better food and drinks!!! What a rip off!!! The owner should be embarrassed. Had a post graduation party for my son with 20 close family and friends on May 17th. They reserved the pool room for us. We had the best time, our server , she was amazing. Great vibe!  Thank you Cap City for a great memory!!!"

    "reviews": "I was hanging with family downtown Denver, walking the 16th Street Mall, then getting very hungary. After a few minutes of looking for a place to eat, we noticed Henry's Tavern.\nWe decided this was the place and walked into a great experience.\nThe food was so delicious! Everything from the atmosphere and our server made for a great experience.\nNext time we're downtown, you can bet this is where we will be. I just hope our next server is just as good as Joseph. Food and cocktails were good but it\u2019s too expensive I think.  It is a fantastic happy hour spot though and I give them the 3.5/5 for the happy hour as I usually only come here during that time.\n\nOff happy hour, 2 entries + 1 cocktail + 2 draft beers was ~$100 out the door.  This place is not worth it for that. The food wasn't bad for the most part. The burger, shrimp tacos, and fries were all okay for a late night eat. The wings on the other hand were barely fried- or baked. You can tell from how wet/soft they look in pics. Sadly, we weren't acknowledged for 17 minutes after we were seated. Seeing as how we arrived 1.5 hours before closing, there weren't many people in there at all. A handful to be exact, but we were made to feel as though it was busy or that we were an inconvenience. I'm sure Henry's would be an okay place during game night. For me, it's a never again. Great Spot with an Incredible Beer Selection!\nI\u2019ve never seen a place with so many different kinds of beer \u2013 truly impressive. The service was friendly, attentive, and very courteous. The burger was excellent \u2013 thank you for that! Amazing service and great fresh food. I also really appreciate the wide selection of non alcoholic beers and mocktails.

I ordered the smoked prime rib and swapped out the potatoes for Brussels sprouts.\n\nAdmittedly, I don\u2019t order prime rib very often, but this was probably the best I\u2019ve ever had. I actually forgot it was smoked until I took the first bite and was pleasantly surprised by the great smoky taste and a perfect crust that added a nice texture.\n\nThe Brussels sprouts were also delicious and a great complement to the meal.\n\nOverall, it was a fantastic experience, and it definitely won't be so long for my next visit. My girlfriend and I was at an Art Expo at Embassy Suite and decided to go to Stout Street Social for brunch. It was our first time going. We both order The Hangover Burger, Mimosa Pineapple & Mimosa Cranberry. The food was excellent, and the drinks were on point. Drusten our server was great. He checked on us the whole time. If you haven\u2019t been, I recommend you go check it out. I got take out the smoked prime rib. It actually tasted good but my piece was super fatty. Almost half of my 10 oz was pure fat. I wouldn't buy again if that's the case. The staff was nice and the atmosphere seemed like a good place to get a drink. I should have checked first because I wouldn't pay this price for half fat. We had a wonderful time at Stout Street social!\nI have the lamb burger and it was just perfect. We also had the goat cheese mushroom appetizer and it was unreal. If you're looking for a good restaurant with good service the place to be. Also there oysters were perfectly fresh! This place was awesome! As someone who worked in the restaurant industry I love open kitchens and this one did not disappoint, we had front row seats! We dined on a Saturday night and this place was BUSY! Everything was on point! The service from our waiter, and we had 14 people, drinks from the bar and food were all excellent! The kitchen was humming all night, they were putting out great food, communicating well, keeping the place clean and the manager running expo was stellar, it was like going to a orchestra and watching her conduct themselves kitchen team.

    "reviews": "The food was phenomenal! The service could have been much better, especially considering the location and price. Forgetting drinks, not getting the order right on a 2 person table, etc are just things you would think this place would be better than. It's a 5 star location, 5 star food, but 2 star service. One of the funnest solo dining experiences I have had in the US.  Went here on a Friday night where there is love piano and singing performance.\n\nThe prime rib is really good and they are very generous with the portion (maybe cause I dined late there.)\n\nThe decoration is fun and there are many details to be adored. Overall, a very enjoyable experience especially if you are staying at the hotel. For a $28 salad, is it too much to ask for the lettuce to be chopped up? Maybe I\u2019m just not a fancy person, but having to saw through a romaine lettuce head with a butter knife is a little tricky. The Caesar dressing and everything was good, I just wished it was all mixed together and easier to eat. If you do get a salad, add some meat because the portion is not big. I didn\u2019t mind overall because of the good service and fun tavern atmosphere. Went for the bar in the foyer. The entertainment was fantastic, and the vibe was nice. The drinks tasted yummy but the cosmo had very little booze. For $17 for one drink, this was very disappointing. I wouldn\u2019t recommend going unless the drinks significantly improve OR the price is cut in half. $8 is justifiable for these beverages. This is a well-done ship-themed restaurant that's been around since 1934. It's a great place to get a drink or meet with friends, but the food is average and overpriced. Some unusual dishes, like the Cordon-Blue pasta, have a mustard flavor, so your mileage may vary. The restaurant itself has the kind of touches you would expect from 1934 when things were made to last. I'd visit again for the bar and the great atmosphere, but skip a full meal."

There were screens everywhere showing various matches\u2014football, soccer, and more\u2014paired with loud rock music that made the atmosphere quite noisy. The place itself was nice and fairly crowded, but the initial welcome was underwhelming; the hostesses didn\u2019t even greet us with a simple \u201cgood evening,\u201d which set the tone.\n\nThankfully, the table service made up for it a bit. The waitress who served us was quick, talkative, but very kind and attentive. We were served water without asking, and the food arrived promptly\u2014most of us got our meals at the same time, which is always a plus.\n\nI ordered the whiskey mushroom burger. It was okay\u2014not bad, but far from memorable. The cheese was tasteless, and while the meat was cooked properly, it lacked depth and richness. There was no standout flavor that left me impressed. Honestly, I wouldn\u2019t come back just for the food.\n\nLastly, the payment system was fully automated\u2014you pay through a device at the table instead of interacting with a server. I\u2019m not sure why dining out is becoming a self-service experience. If I go to a restaurant, I expect to be served, not to do everything myself. This push for automation takes away from the warmth and hospitality a restaurant should offer. I stumbled into this place actually looking for another restaurant. Wow was I glad i tried it out. What a fun environment, great food, and quick friendly service with a smile. The Ahi sandwich was out of this world. It was seared perfectly, and the seasoning was on point. The Korean classic wings were large and flavorful. Needed lots of napkins. The onion rings were so.e of the best I have had in a while. Great food, great service and nice atmosphere! I ordered the Chicken Nachos and a Lemon Drop Martini. The food was fresh and hot. The server was friendly and attentive with great recommendations. I\u2019d recommend others to visit. This was a pleasant experience for our family of 6. The food was great and the portions were large.  Visited especially for the Onion Tower. Two people could have eaten off one Fish and Chips order. My grandson loved the Otange Chicken which was more than this teenager could eat in one sitting! \ud83d\ude0b I came here alone on a Sunday night. I requested a booth and they gave me one in the perfect people watching position:)\n\nI ordered a sour beer and the poke salad.

Pretty solid little bar with some good deals and surprisingly good food.  I liked the overall vibe and space - this spot seems like a neighborhood establishment in the Triangle. Honestly one of my favorite places in Denver. Great, quiet back patio. I used to tell people \"it's great except for the food\" but the new food situation is great. The chicken sandwich is bomb. Yea, it's a bit unconventional in that you have to order it separately from bar orders and yes the hours might leave a little bit to be desired but that's capitalism, baby. Plus, if your biggest complaint is that you have to order food separately I'm gonna play a really tiny violin for you. Even on a sunny, Sunday afternoon the vibes at Dulce Vida were chill. The bartender was very friendly and made me feel at home. There was also the best boy, Chooch (I hope that's how it's spelled), who added to the coziness. I didn't get any alcohol but you don't need any to enjoy this place with some friends. I can't wait to visit again and try the food! I don\u2019t usually leave bad reviews, but this one earned it. My husband and I live nearby and figured we\u2019d finally check this place out. The patio was nice, the bartender was super sweet and for a second, we thought this might actually be a decent spot to frequent more. It\u2019s not.\n\nWhile I went back inside to close our tab, there were two guys at the bar with a dog. As I walked up, the dog lunged at me. No bark. No warning. Just full-on claws to the legs. I\u2019ve got scratches and bruises to prove it. I jumped back before it actually had a chance to bite me. But here\u2019s the real kicker, the owners of the dog laughed. Laughed. Not in horror. Not nervously. Like it was the funniest thing they\u2019d seen all day. Then, as if to ensure no one left this situation with any etiquette intact, the bartender says, \u201cMaybe you should put a muzzle on your dog \u2014 this isn\u2019t the first time.\u201d\n\nExcuse me? Not the first time? So we\u2019re just hosting casual near-miss dog attacks now? And then pouring another round?\n\nWe were too stunned to say anything in the moment.\n\nDon\u2019t come here. Unless you're into watching dogs lunge at people while their owners laugh and the staff shrugs. Some places are hidden gems. This one should stay hidden."

    "reviews": "It's kinda like a Dave and Buster's, with the similar problem of every other game having something broken on it. Right gun on Big Buck Hunter didn't work. The wheel on the Mario Kart second from the left was about to fall off. Even the photo booth didn't take decent pictures. Overall I'd much rather go somewhere like Round 1 for a better version of this type of experience. We came here to play some arcade games on a slow afternoon. FTW has a Dave and Buster's feel to it, but nicer. This establishment also has Lucky Strike attached to it, so you can bowl here as well. It's really a great spot in the mall area for an afternoon of games. At first entering the building was confusing & getting a server was too. However,  the food won me over, the Cubano was so delicious! The mermaid drink was SO good, but $13 for the size of the skinny glass I got, not worth it and I wanted another too. Connected to the bowling alley. Need a reservation.  Kinda small, but your dollar goes further than Dave n Busters and near lots of other things to do. Good selection of games and friendly staff. This place is crawling with people. They\u2019re everywhere. We kept rolling back and forth between the bowling area because they are connected. We showed up, ordered drinks, reserved a lane, then bought points for the arcade and waited until we were called. Ordering drinks, ordering food, this was one of the best nights I\u2019ve had in a long time. It felt like we were in \u2018safe Vegas\u2019 for the evening, haha. This is a place worth spending the whole evening and enjoying the surrounding area while you wait for a lane."

    "reviews": "This week, I found myself in Denver, Colorado, and my first stop was Appaloosa Grill. I wanted to give this place a 4.5-star rating\u2014the food was great\u2014but one major issue brought it way down for me: mandatory tipping.\n\nI started with a Horse\u2019s Neck. It was just okay. For my main, I ordered the NY strip and fries. The steak was cooked perfectly and was well-seasoned. The French fries were awesome\u2014crispy, flavorful, just how I like them.\n\nService was okay, not amazing, but not bad either. What really soured the experience was being automatically charged a tip while sitting alone at the bar. I understand adding gratuity for large parties, but for a solo diner? That\u2019s just not right. It takes away the choice to reward good service on your own terms.\n\nBecause of that policy, I\u2019m giving Appaloosa Grill 2.5 stars. Great food, but the forced tipping is a deal-breaker for me\u2014and I imagine for many others too. 10/5 stars really!\n\nOur serve was Brit, and she was the sweetest thing!! We felt entirely taken care of. She gave the BEST recommendations, like i mean she picked out our entire meal in a way and it was the best meal we\u2019ve had in a long time.\n\nTheir bison filet was mouth watering. You don\u2019t need any sides it\u2019s that good. The elk burger was DELISH. Their drinks, specifically green chile margarita, drop the beat, paper plane martini and house neck were amazing! Went perfectly with the meal, strong and tasted good.\n\nThey have live music that we just missed and wish we could have stayed for. Overall was and AMAZING experience!! We LOVED BRIT!! Gosh, I\u2019ve became a regular the past week and appreciate Madi as a server. The New York strip was cooked to perfection, great potato's &  asparagus. Also great burger. Unfortunately was spit on by Kevin at the front door for no reason. Pretty appalling. Great spot for food & live music otherwise. The Elk burger with semi grape compote and some sort of creamy cheese blend and spices, enough greens stacked for the combined crunch with the toasted bun. I chose sweet potato fries for variety, however I'll try the regular fries next time for the salt balance, and Yes, there WILL BE a next time.\n\nHow can you miss with music EVERY NIGHT. Someone has made the commitment to keep the World working by creating this place that stands in the face of \"whatever happens to a cool part of town eventually\".\n\nI watched some drunken businessmen devour the bone marrow special and was intrigued. They say order that earlier in the evening, especially if it's busy.\n\nSpecial shout-out to the artist who writes the band schedule on the chalkboard. If those aren't the official logos of the musical acts, then they Should be. Appaloosa Grill\n\nLocated at 535 16th St #110 in Denver, Appaloosa Grill boasts a solid 4.3-star rating based on nearly 3,000 reviews. However, my recent visit left me underwhelmed, and I have a few thoughts to share.\n\nAs I approached the restaurant, I was greeted by ongoing construction along 16th Street, which created an uninviting atmosphere and disrupted the overall experience. While this isn\u2019t the restaurant\u2019s fault, it certainly contributed to my initial impression. Upon entering, I noticed the place was nearly empty, which raised my eyebrows given its otherwise impressive rating.\n\nAfter being told to sit anywhere, we chose a table near the door, a decision we quickly regretted. Every time the door swung open, the chilly Denver air rushed in, prompting us to relocate to a more sheltered spot at the back.\n\nWhen our server arrived, I asked for recommendations and was promptly directed to the Bison Burger. Excited to try it, we placed our order. Unfortunately, when the burger arrived, it was lukewarm and lacked the appealing presentation I had hoped for. Taking my first bite was a disappointment, as the flavor and texture reminded me of a frozen burger you'd find at a little league game\u2014not quite what I expected from a bison dish in a restaurant setting.\n\nWhile Appaloosa Grill may have a following for its location and live music offerings, I found it more akin to a dive bar. The bar selection might attract some patrons, only for me, this visit didn't showcase the culinary excellence I had anticipated. I left feeling that perhaps the menu had other hidden gems, only my experience with the bison burger was a total miss.\n\nTo add to my discontent, an automatic 20% tip was applied to our bill, which the waitress explained was shared among the staff. She was certainly the highlight of my visit, as her service was the only positive aspect of the experience. I added additional specifically for the waitress. However, I found the automatic gratuity policy somewhat unsettling.\n\nWhile I wanted to love Appaloosa Grill and understand the high rating based on other reviews, my experience fell short. Perhaps with a different menu choice or a more favorable atmosphere, my opinion might change, only  for now, I\u2019d recommend stopping by for drinks rather than a full meal."

    "reviews": "Very quiet. Different vibe from the other rooftop bars. No matter the weather you can still get beautiful views. Which we enjoyed. The drinks were great. The food was okay. The cake was a little dry but the edamame was yummy! I had a great experience with great views and great food. Waiter did a great job at keeping the table. Happy despite the kitchen being out of half the menu. Keylime cheesecake was outstanding. I had an amazing dining experience at Peak, a rooftop restaurant with stunning views. The panoramic cityscape, especially at sunset, creates the perfect ambiance for a memorable evening.\n\nThe staff were attentive and provided excellent service throughout the night.\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for a place with both incredible food and breathtaking views, Peak is a must-visit! Beautiful views of Denver in a chill setting on the 27th floor of the Hyatt Regency next to Denver\u2019s convention center. This is a perfect place to view Denver\u2018s holiday drone show\u2026 7 PM every evening until the end of December\u2026 Service is always friendly and the drinks are tasty, the food is good too and great for a light snack with friends and family. Great outing to show visitors the Denver skyline! We came here after all the other bars in town were closed or closing. The food was good so was the service but the atmosphere was amazing. The views were amazing! The place was packed!! The staff was super nice & trying to keep up with all the people they were trying to serve. Glad I was staying on the 29th floor, it was a safe ride back to my room."

    "reviews": "There was not very many people in there, and there\u2019s no wonder why. Not only did it take a while to get service, but they were rude about it. We are ordering with drinks, and it seem to be an inconvenience. They did not have any type of seltzer or twisted tea type of options. The best they could do was lemon vodka, and either lemonade or tea as a suggestion. Was not very clean in my opinion. I definitely will not be going back. The restroom was horrible and the door would not shut. I was really surprised at how good the food is at the Pub on Penn. The tacos are some of the best I\u2019ve had. We were staying at the Capitol Hill Bed & Breakfast and wanted a quick bite late in the evening. The Pub is very close so we gave it a try and now I would probably go out of my way to go back for the tacos! Best sportbar in Denver with best bartender. I had one hamburger and som lager beer. Very nice place to visit, casual and very friendly.6 What a fun place! Trivia Wednesdays are extra fun, everyone is very nice, and the food helps you along the way Great local pub vibe.\n\nI\u2019ve stopped by twice this weekend and love having it as my go-to neighborhood bar.\n\nYou really can\u2019t beat the location, being close to everything Capitol Hill has to offer, but nicely tucked away on a side street, adding to its neighborhood feel. The staff is super friendly, remembering me after just my first visit and making sure to attend to me quickly even when I come in alone with a book.\n\nAlthough it has a dive bar thing going on, the food is excellent and fresh. A huge thumbs up to the French fries - warm and crispy!\n\nGiven its sports bar leaning the place can attract a bit of a rowdy crowd once in a while, but more often than not it\u2019s super chill and a great place to hang on a hot afternoon.\n\nI am so glad to have this bar as my regular local hangout and look forward to reporting on how it compares to other places on Capitol Hill."

We were warmly greeted by CT and he made sure to sit us in a timely manner. He really set the tone well for the night with his positive energy and friendly attitude. We got the churrasco poutine, steak Diane, and the Brussels sprouts. Everything was delicious and cooked PERFECTLY. I will for sure becoming back to try other menu items. Colorful, cozy atmosphere. Menu has a lot of playful choices. Oysters were good but the bread for both the crab pretzel and sliders were burnt. Drinks were ok. Would come back to try for brunch! Revival is a solid bar and restaurant. The food was very tasty with just the right size portions. The service was phenomenal. The Bartender\u2019s were phenomenal even on a Sunday afternoon. Live music was on point also. Highly recommend. Mica gave us the best experience here! The pork belly and cornbread was incredible! I also loved the flatline burger! Solid 4/5 for me.  Fantastic atmosphere, good food, decent service, and overpriced, but good drinks.\n\nFirst they had live music when I visited that really fit the vibe well.  I loved the space and internal decor.\n\nFood was hit or miss for me personally.  I got this pork belly app that was amazing.  The catfish and grits was okay - catfish itself amazing, but the grits that surrounded the catfish I\u2019ve made better at home.  Also tried the crab and crawfish soup and did not like it.\n\nTook roughly 45 minutes to get our food and service was sparse to check in on us, but the folks were very nice.\n\nI\u2019ll come back - I really want to try out some of their other food!\n\n2 drinks, 1 app, 1 cup of soup, and 1 entree for ~$105.  Overpriced app and soup, but the entree was huge and worth it."

    "reviews": "We finally made it!  We tried to stop here while visiting Denver last summer, but the line to get in was super long and we just didn\u2019t have the time to wait.  But this time!!!  We waited and it was well worth the wait!  We ordered the pastrami Reuben with curry potato salad and the turkey club with pasta salad.  We were near speechless while we ate our food.  Lots of humming because it was that good!!!  Our sandwiches were huge and we each took home half.  The sides were delicious and well flavored.  The Pickles!!!!! Phenomenal! We were blown away with our meals!  We will for sure incorporate plenty of wait time into our next Denver trip for this amazing food!\n\nWe ate inside this time and loved the plants and decor.  There are also plenty of tables outside as well.  Friendly staff and great service. Highly recommend! Love the energy in this place. It\u2019s very welcoming and the food is made with care. It was my first time so they gave me a free brownie (amazing).\n\nI ordered the turkey club which is a BLT with turkey on it. Homemade toasted bread and a giant sandwich. It came with a side - I ordered the pasta salad which had a hint of dill which was tasty and they included house made pickle slices. Hands down, a wonderful experience with food made from passion. Admirable quality through and through\u2026 plus they serve Hazlo for NA people like me! The Pastrami Reuben sandwich was the best pastrami sandwich I have ever had. The curry potato salad was pretty cool too. The pickles were way salty and I couldn\u2019t finish all of them. The snickerdoodle, chocolate chip, and oatmeal raisin cookies were all decent. Service was fast and friendly. Prices are high for a sandwich but the portion sizes are large thanks to the sides.\n\nThis place also lost stars from me due to their 10% quality fee. It isn\u2019t shown on their menu and it\u2019s only announced on a tiny board at the cash register. Just work these costs in your prices and stop trying to trick your customers! And pay your staff a living wage yourself! Even though this was probably my best meal in Denver, I probably won\u2019t return unless they revise this fee. Absolutely wonderful food (I had the macaroni salad and chocolate chip cookie and I can\u2019t wait to try more). Easy parking on the street (it is metered\u2026 but cheap). Great atmosphere and comfortable with choosing it as a business meeting. Definitely a great neighborhood food establishment. I will be back! We had a great lunch at Leven today. The service and food were top notch. I don\u2019t know that I\u2019ve had a better pastrami sandwich anywhere including NYC or Chicago. We got the kale salad and macaroni salad sides and they were very tasty and fresh. The large homemade cookies were tempting too\u2026next time! We got here at 11am and there was no wait. By the time we left around 1230 there was a line out the door."

The sweet fries on the side were decent, but nothing that really stood out.\n\nA solid spot to check out, but not necessarily a must-try. Fun spot! I really like the inside atmosphere. We showed up about 30 minutes before happy  hour. Good beer selection on draft and great food! I had the French dip and my husband tried the Denver cheesesteak with a few modifications (different cheese and green chile on the side). Homemade ranch! Mm! Had a fantastic Sunday evening at Park & Co in Denver! We sat at the bar and were served by Jennifer C who was incredibly friendly and attentive.\n\nI ordered the French Dip, which was absolutely delicious \u2013 the tender beef and perfectly toasted bread were spot on (as you can see from the photo!).\n\nThe atmosphere was very quiet, likely due to the late hour, which made for a relaxing dining experience. Jennifer C.'s excellent service made our experience even better. Highly recommend Park & Co for a great meal! Happy hour every day 3-6pm\nUptown nachos and a 36 oz. boot of Coors light filled me up at a solid price! \u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f A Perfect Spot for Casual Vibes & Seriously Good Fries\n\nMy wife and I stumbled on Park & Co while staying nearby, and we\u2019re so glad we did. The vibe is exactly what you want for a relaxed night out\u2014casual, stylish, and welcoming, with a fun local energy that feels like a neighborhood favorite.\n\nThe food? Delicious. We both ordered burgers, which were juicy and packed with flavor, but the real standout was the fries. Crispy, golden, perfectly seasoned\u2014they\u2019re the kind of fries you find yourself still picking at long after you\u2019re full. Definitely worth a mention on their own!\n\nDrinks were great, too\u2014solid craft beer selection and some creative cocktails. The staff was friendly without being overbearing, and service was quick even though it was pretty busy. We\u2019ll definitely be back the next time we\u2019re in Denver.\n\nHighly recommend if you\u2019re in the area and want something unpretentious but still really well done."

The donuts were warm and made to order.  The service was excellent and the atmosphere was fun and funky.  Would highly recommend. Perfectly good breakfast, lunch or dinner spot. Love that we got to choose different flavors of their mini donuts. Raspberry and lemon were top notch. Plus you can get gluten free. Breakfast burrito is FAT! My hash was delicious and I substituted the housemade biscuit for toast. Too bad it was pretty dense and dry. Appreciate the dog friendly patio! The entire theme of the restaurant was incredibly adorable. From all of the retro cereal boxes to the Star Wars themed restroom. The food was tasty - I mean, blueberry lavender pancakes, dude?! Hell yeah! \ud83e\udd1f\ud83c\udffeI will definitely be back. I have visited DU a couple of times from out of town. Jelly Cafe has become my go-to for breakfast when I visit. The chilaquiles here are amazing, with just the right green chili spice and red onion. My daughter gets cinnamon pancakes, a solid choice. We shared donut bites-so good, esp. the jelly one! The service is on point, there when you need them. And the interior is engaging and fun. It's a joy to eat here. Cute little brunch spot. Friendly staff, great menu selection, untouched consistency and quality. I'm partial towards getting their classic Benedict but on a biscuit, with crispy potatoes. Easily one of the best biscuits in Denver and really elevates the Benedict experience by not becoming sopped up like an English muffin will. Courtney behind the breakfast bar was super attentive and kind with so much patience with it being so busy. Highly recommend to anybody looking for a quality breakfast/brunch experience!"

This is such a fun spot with corgi decor and hilarious videos playing on the tvs. Our server Jake took great care of us. The food, drinks, and price make this a place definitely worth stopping into! Decided to finally try this place and we weren't disappointed! Josh took great care of us with drinks, awesome food that came out quick and hot, and even made us a custom drink, a \"Thin Mint or Something\" spin on an espresso martini that was fire!! Hopefully WCP puts it on the menu!! We will certainly be back!! Cool vibes, excellent chicken wings. Alabama white sauce was excellent. I really want to give it 5 stars, but they had one server for the whole place on an NFL playoff Sunday. I hope multiple people called out, because that just seems silly. Food was excellent, but we waited 40+ minutes for it. Dusty was very nice and friendly,  the drinks was good.. the food was OUTSTANDING!!! I had the steak sandwich with fries..\nMy friend had told me about this months ago and finally she took us! Everything was so wonderful..I had to bring my food home.. but I would definitely recommend Wild Corgi Pub!!\nPictures included.."

Can\u2019t express how AMAZING the food was! 20/10! I very much enjoy the food here. It was the first restaurant I ever visited in Denver and set a great tone. I particularly enjoy the fried ravioli with pesto. I also love the vegan chicken and waffles as well as the breakfast burrito. I love than you can do real or vegan eggs and cheese. I wouldn\u2019t call this healthy food by any stretch. It has a somewhat unique twist on comfort food made vegan. The bathrooms are a whole vibe with stickers covering everything.  This place is unique and is good for people who are vegan/vegetarian. Wife and I stopped for a late breakfast after traveling for most of the day.\n\nWe were seated quickly by friendly team members. Much of the menu sounds good but we tried the Chicken and Waffles, breakfast sandwich w/fries, and a winnie palmer lemonade.\n\nI cannot more highly recommend the chicken and waffles.

Vegan or vegetarian or carnivore, everyone will love their food \ud83c\udf31 Seriously, amazing. Came here for a late dinner and drinks and we were not disappointed. As a \"Dry\" Vegetarian diner, this is the type of place I wish existed in my teens/20s. So many options for Zero proof and Non-Alc. drinks, we will be back!

But honestly, they do such a great job packaging everything and putting it together for a to-go meal. The food was amazing and super satisfying\u2014definitely enough for two meals! Worth every penny for the quality and the portion size. Definitely would recommend and eat again! Came here to dine in (Not hibachi) and was pleasantly surprised! I ordered the chicken katsu and it was delicious! It was also a huge portion. All dishes we ordered were great portions for the price we paid. This was my first time at Hibachi and it was for my birthday! I got sushi and Rangoons for an appetizer and the chicken and steak combo! Which I didn\u2019t get a picture of but it was a good portion. It was such a fun experience and food was good! I would definitely recommend! Amazing sushi with a great variety. The sushi was presented beautifully and tasted fantastic. I did not try the hibachi, however, from observing the other guests being served, I could tell the hibachi chef was equally as talented. The decor was pleasant however nothing extraordinarily extravagant. The food itself is reasonably priced, with menu options as cheap as $10-15 before tip, as well as an option for all-you-can-eat sushi for around $35. Overall I would recommend if you are in the mood for some delicious Japanese food. My filet mignon & the clear soup were good and the salad was ok. Unfortunately I didn\u2019t enjoy the rest of the hibachi meal. The drinks were good too, the cook was entertaining, & Cyrus\u2019s customer service was exceptional! You come here for the atmosphere. I was having so much fun that this was the only pic I so carelessly took ^_^"

A great sports bar and spot for large groups to hang. We attend their weekly trivia on Wednesdays (which happens to be on the unlimited wings night). It\u2019s always packed and a fun two hour activity. Highly recommend Stoney\u2019s in the summer as they have two great outdoor patios and can open all the windows. Great local sports bar! The food here was really good and the outdoor seating area was extremely nice. I asked the server for a drink recommendation and it was great and a few others from the table also ordered it after seeing it. The nachos was big for one person but it hit the spot and overall the price wasnt too bad for a lot of food and good drinks. Not the nicest sports bar (lots of spilled drinks!) But great food/portions- peep these nachos, friendly staff, and so many TVs. Easy to watch whatever you like here. I went to Stoney\u2019s Uptown Joint to watch the Detroit Lions vs. San Francisco 49ers game, and let me tell you, it was one of the most disappointing experiences I\u2019ve had in a long time.\n\nI grabbed some food and a Pepsi during halftime and tipped $3.50, but even though I was paying for my stuff, I was asked to leave. I\u2019m homeless, but I\u2019m clean and just trying to watch the game like everyone else. It felt like I was asked to leave just because of that.\n\nSo, I stepped outside to watch the game through the window, but then they told me I couldn\u2019t even stand on the sidewalk to do that. Seriously? I wasn\u2019t being disruptive\u2014I just wanted to enjoy the game. I was asked to leave three times, but I stuck it out, defiant, and watched the game through the cold until the end. I wasn\u2019t leaving until the Lions won\u2014and they did, with a final score of 40-34!\n\nThe Lions winning was definitely the highlight of my day, but it\u2019s hard to shake how poorly I was treated during the experience. I believe in kindness, and I tipped $3.50, but I still wasn\u2019t shown any in return. It\u2019s honestly really frustrating to be treated this way when all I was doing was trying to enjoy the game. No one should be treated like this, no matter their situation.\n\nA public apology and a free meal, along with a Pepsi (I don\u2019t drink alcohol, so that would be perfect), would go a long way, and I would definitely consider changing my review from one star to five, given how I was treated tonight. I really hope the management takes a look at how they handle situations like this and makes sure no one else has to deal with it."

    "reviews": "Best brewery on Colfax! It also has a sneaky good bbq vendor inside. Great vibes and great staff I love this place \u2013 the beer and barbecue are amazing-great vibe. From the commitment to music and community to the great art and dog photos - so much cool- just a gem. If anybody\u2019s ever had their beers, you should stop by and show some love at this new location.  Great range of Brews all in a chill environment. If you own a dog bring an 8 x 10  photo of your 4 legged friend so they can hang it  up on the wall and you get a free beer.  I love when breweries do small, quirky things to make them more memorable. Visited after work on a Wednesday. Enjoyed the bar services by JD. Conversations were inspired and service was attentive. He also made sure to support new patrons coming in. He even came over to our table to take our orders though I was assured that was something out of the ordinary.\nGood beer, apparently they did enough business to sell out of many taps so they had lots of guest brews. After tasting some I was motivated to buy a pack of the fantastic summer strawberry cream ale(?)\nEverything was amazing, thank you JD. A truly amazing taproom.  We were greeted immediately by Roby, who was bartending, with a warm smile and welcome.  He was extremely knowledgeable on the beers, area and music scene.  The food was also amazing, highly recommend the Mac n Cheese brisket!   A must stop for any beer, food or music enthusiast."

Beer was great, they helped my friend pick the perfect IPA. They now take credit cards so that is an added bonus. Vine St Pub is a very easy place to frequent.  Good food, great service, free street parking and good folks, all around.  From a Thursday Music Night stage perspective, the audiences are welcoming, loud at times which is hard to perform through, but most seem to enjoy hearing a live band, even if it's not always their jam.  No cover is a public's bonus these days.  Keep supporting them!  They keep supporting Us musicians which is beautiful. Awesome place. Very homie, everyone is very nice. Good food and beer selection. Tell me a better place for a beer, burgers, and just a great atmosphere!  Unpretentious, no fluff, grrreat combo of salads and veg fare!  ANNNNND, Thursday night jazz? Gahead\u2026 tell me a better gig.  Try the Korean BBQ wings.  Old fav for a quality brewpub but new fav for burgers and vibes!  If you liked pre-Covid, you\u2019re in for a whole new level of qual! Outdoor patio avail! Their BLT was great. Their spinach and artichoke dip was definitely different than most places, it was served with veggies and chips which we did love, but it was just okay. My partner had their pizza and thought it was delicious and their fried chicken tenders for kids seems like a very large portion.  No domestic beer, but common for a gasgropub. The service was also a bit strange as I have worked in service before and it is very common to help out your co-workers with running food. But we probably talked about 6 people that were there and none of them knew what was going on at our table with the beers that we were drinking and food we were eating so this made sometimes things a little awkward."

    "reviews": "Great bar vibe and wide food/beer selection. Deep dish pizza didn\u2019t come out scalding hot as I expected, but definitely one of the best deep dish places in Denver. I\u2019m not from Chicago however, so take this review with a grain of salt. Great service, 9/10 pizza and 10 outta 10 wings. Whoever is the cook was def cooking. \ud83e\udee1\ud83d\udd25 Nice neighborhood spot with great pizza and wings. FYI self seating and order at the bar. I love this place. The only good deep dish pizza in Denver. Service is great considering it's just the bartenders doing it all (you order at the bar). But they're fast and smart. Mike was excellent and super competent. It's loud but it's a pub! And they have Palisades Peach on tap which is my all time favorite draft brew. Ratings are high so I thought the pizza was going to be pretty good. Just ordered a small deep dish, that was the only food I had. As someone who grew up in Illinois I was looking forward to a good slice of deep dish pizza. It wasn\u2019t good at all. The cornmeal crust was thin and pretty crunchy. One of the main distinctions of a deep dish pizza is the cornmeal crust, definitely could be thicker with a better taste. The sauce was oh so powerful. So much oregano. I don\u2019t know if someone accidentally put that much in but it was like eating a bite out of the actual plant. I haven\u2019t tried the other food so that might be the way to go. If you have never had deep dish, then you might like it. Service was fast with my pickup and the atmosphere was bumpin for a Sunday night. Edit: looks like there is new management or a change in the kitchen. Could be why this hyped up place didn\u2019t live up to the word."

    "reviews": "What a gem! We enjoyed both of their famous mussels, an assortment of their appetizers and the lamb sliders. Truly one of the most delicious meals I e had in a long time.  The ambiance was perfect for catching up.\nI have to add our delight at their mock tail and n/a beer selection. We capped the meal off with the perfect pallet cleansing orange poppy seed tea cake. 10/10 recommend! Stopped in on a whim and had a lovely time. The tacos (ordered beef and the veggie) were delicious as were the drinks. Kristin was so nice to talk to and made an excellent recommendation for the orange cake and books to read :). All of the staff were attentive and friendly. Should I find myself back in Denver, I\u2019ll make a point to stop by this wonderful spot again! Great vibes, cocktails, warm service, tasty food but laughably small portions. We ordered some dips and a French dip. The dips were about 2 tablespoons each for $9 and the French dip sandwich looked like it belonged in a happy meal and barely had any meat in it. Left hungry - not sure if they\u2019re trying to cut costs but I\u2019d rather pay more and get a full meal. In the current state I\u2019d recommend it more as a bar than a restaurant. Gorgeous place with a cute patio. Martinis and mussels HH- I see it; I want it. Really good cocktails & impressive selection from classics to modern. This is such a gem! They could totally work as just a cocktail lounge, but oh no, they also have a really great kitchen. The perfect place to kick off your evening out, swing in for a night cap and a snack, or spend a Saturday afternoon drinking on the patio. The vibe is great, staff is wonderful, and it\u2019s woman owned!\nThey just started hosting the occasional burlesque show as well so keep an eye out for There events. The space is small but they can really pack in a good time."

Parking is a struggle as this streets around here are bumper to bumper but if you get an opportunity do not pass this spot up. Went yesterday august 18 for beers and soda. My husband really liked the first IPA and I loved the root beer. The orange cream soda was too sweet and I didn\u2019t like the ginger ale. Great bartender. Met the small black dog who is 17 years old and just the sweetest puppy ever! Bathroom is very clean and well stocked. They had games and cards and we played a few hands. Great little place with a cozy neighborhood vibe and drinks come in three sizes so trying a small beee is possible. Best brewery in Denver.  The atmosphere is right and the beer is highest quality.  Highly recommend. Very family friendly spot with games for kids and flights for parents. Kids enjoyed popcorn and Root Beer, and we tried four different brews including a new Cherry Limeade seltzer that was my personal favorite. Highly recommend! Such a fun location near Ogden theater! Feels like home. In winter the fireplace makes it feel like everyone is family. Yummy homemade sodas for those who don\u2019t drink beer. Definitely check this place out. Great beer and owners!!!!  We come every time we are in the neighborhood!"

    "reviews": "Middleman is an amazing cocktail bar. We also LOVE the food at Misfit Snack Bar (which is part of Middleman). The burger is always on the menu (and is amazing) and they rotate their menu frequently. The drinks are super unique and inventive. The staff is lovely and they make everyone feel like regulars. They also host really fun events. We recently went near Halloween and they hosted a pumpkin carving contest with fun prizes and swags. Highly recommend! Middleman, a cocktail bar conveniently located near the Bluebird Theater, offered a delightful and efficient pre-show dining experience. The bar service, provided by multiple friendly staff members, was both attentive and quick!\n\nDuring our recent visit, last Saturday, we were able to check out Misfit Snack Bar, which was featuring a special menu with a passed hors DimSum offering $5 per bite food items.  We sampled and shared the French Kiss Tartine, Jamaican Beef Toasted Ravioli, Sweet Potato Fondant, and Nashville Hot Roulade and the My Fu**ing Slider. We found the Jamaican Beef Ravioli, the French Kiss Tartine, and the Slider to be exceptional standouts!\n\nThe cocktail menu was equally impressive, featuring well-crafted and flavorful drinks. It was a great place to get in and out of pretty quick before heading over to our show. The only thing I wasn't a huge fan of was the $5 cover charge, since we weren't there for the rest of the event and only stopped in for a quick bite. I am still giving 5 stars because it\u2019s one of my favorite places to go! But the service here is SOOO hit or miss. If I sit at the bar it\u2019s perfect, whenever I sit at a table, horrid. The food is next level we all know this. The drinks are great! Thunder kiss though strong is such a great tiki cocktail. The new menus are very funny. I will be back again and again for misfit kitchen! I couldn\u2019t love this place more. Visited twice, with a year between those visits, and the quality, service and taste is consistently amazing. It\u2019s hard to not order the whole snack menu - and even harder to decide which cocktail to get. Very chill but def good service - it\u2019s a cocktail bar, we had no need to be in a hurry and love that about the vibe here. It was negative temperatures outside and they had additional option for potato soup which was outstanding. Can\u2019t wait to see the next menu iteration! Every time I've been here, it's been excellent. It has elements of a fancy cocktail lounge mixed with aspects of a dive bar. Bartenders are always mixology experts and have great personalities to boot. Drinks aren't too expensive given how much care is put into the menu, and they're delicious. This is a perfect first date spot if you want your date to think you're classy but not square."

    "reviews": "All staff was great. I didn't eat but those around me said the food was good. I was there to accompany my under 16 year old to see Brandywine. Small and quaint venue but perfect for newer bands trying to make it in the very competitive music industry. We placed an order online for carryout and we definitely had high hopes for this place considering the 4.6 out of five star average review and we were not disappointed. We ordered the XL meat platter and the brisket was absolutely delicious and was fall apart tender 9.5/10, the pulled pork was great but we did have a couple of extremely chewy and burnt pieces but otherwise great 7.8/10, beans were fantastic although the meat was a bit tough 7.4/10, the okra was spot on 9.6/10, the Mac and cheese was fantastic 8.3/10, the Texas toast was kind of lackluster and we didn't enjoy it at all, 3/10, and the slaw was absolutely awful, vinegar taste like crazy, -3/10, the lemon pepper wings had a strong lemon flavor which I loved and weren't dried out like most places 9.2/10, and last but not least the potato salad was pretty damn good but it did have big ass pieces in it 8.1/10. Overall spent approx $60 and I will definitely go back again but definitely swap out the toast and the slaw for something else on the menu. Good vibe in the place and order was ready after my 25 min drive to go pick it up so 8.8/10 on service and ambiance combined. Overall 9.4/10 Goosetown Tavern is great! The staff is really attentive, the food is good, and they feature tons of live music (both local and national artists). It\u2019s one of my favorite spots on Colfax. Pretty good overall, we really wanted cornbread but we were told that they don't have it on the menu anymore, and we weren't able to do loaded fries as a side. The staff was great and attentive the beer and cocktails were great. We would definitely go back. Came in for a late lunch and found a great place to spend the afternoon in Congress Park area.  The staff was polite and attentive specially the young lady who was staffing the bar and was serving the tables.  BBQ was 8 or of 10 with their Bison sausage and briskets the best things on the menu.  Sides were ok but the cornbread stole the show.  Plenty of parking on the streets.  They also have a stage for live music."

    "reviews": "Bruz Off Fax has become a go-to for me in Denver. Their beer selection is consistently impressive, with a wide variety of brews that always deliver on taste. As a big fan of Belgian-style beers, I'm never disappointed by their offerings. Beyond the fantastic beer, Bruz boasts plenty of both indoor and outdoor space, making it a comfortable spot year-round. The ambiance is also a major plus, creating a great environment to enjoy a pint or two. Highly recommend checking them out! Delicious beer selection!\nTry the flights to get a variety of flavors - my favorites were the green ghost and the dawg days! The server there was extremely helpful and after a brief conversation has our flavors dialed in. Two flights later, two happy customers will be back! Recently discovered this spot and gosh did they have a great patio and outdoor section for listening to music that looks like it\u2019s in a container!  Love their beer flights & as a non beer drinker I was impressed by tie IPA\u2019s!! Delicious! Also cute bar area, inside bench areas & lovely pricing! This brewery is a true Denver gem! I've driven by it quite a lot on the way work and finally had a chance to stop in. The outside belies the spacious interior. The atmosphere is incredible with a high bar when you first walk in and steps down to the normal sized bar. There are inset tables as well as plenty of room inside and outside tables on their patio.\n\nI wasn't able to stay too long when I stopped by, but the fruity saisons were superb!\n\nTim was manning the taps and was super friendly and knowledgeable about the beers and the brewery.\n\nI can't wait to go back! A great brewery just off Colfax Ave.\n\nIf you look on their website they have events on nearly every day of the week. Events such as trivia night, $1 off every pour and live music on Saturday nights. There's plenty more and it's easily accessible on their website.\n\nSitting in the outdoor patio is a great place to spend your evening drinking some great Belgium beer. My personal favourite is the right hand man pilsner.\n\nStaff are always friendly and there's always friendly dogs in the patio area."

Huge and juicy shrimp, perfectly cooked steak and everything was super fresh. Very delicious chips and salsa. We will definitely be back . Food was good and not too much, which was great to not have leftovers or have a food baby. BF is a pickier eater and harder to please than I am, but he really liked his Carne de res Burrito with green Chile. I had Chile Rellenos and ate all of it. They have Negra Modelo - yay!\nBoth hostess and our waiter were too young to tell us who the celebrities were in the photos in our booth.\nCool place. They have a whole tequila only menu, with 3 shot flights and some shots costing $39.\nI'd definitely return. Great atmosphere, great food and the best margaritas.  I had the shrimp tacos and beans.  It was really good.  Service was great as well.  \ud83d\udc4c\ud83d\udc4cparking could be challenging. Our favorite spot for the best street tacos, fantastic margaritas, and authentic salsas. Bartender shared with us that their pineapple margaritas are made with tequula infused with pineapple, in-house! I *dream* about the margarita and salsas, often... Overall an absolute gem in Denver. We sat outside and had to fetch the waiters twice.  The food was decent.  While we were happy with our meal we were not excited about it either. My mezcal cocktail was nice. Overall, the food is good but standard for Mexican food restaurant in Denver."

    "reviews": "The stroganoff was absolutely delicious, among the best I've ever had & reminiscent of the best Bologneses I've had. Worth the trip across the metro area & the price. Although I was uncertain initially, it turned out to be the perfect portion size. The jus was so good, I tried drinking it (but that was kind of too rich & obviously ill-advised regardless of my attempt). The staff & atmosphere were pleasant & relaxing. Very happy with my decision to come here. Great destination if you want to drink beer and watch football (soccer). If your going just for food,  no so much. Friend and I went for a St Paddy's meal and were not impressed. Corned beef was dry, cabbage flavorless, and they put coleslaw on the Reuben instead of sauerkraut. French fries and O'Brien taters were good. Wonderful Irish session on Sunday afternoons. Everything on the menu is top-notch - way better than what I\u2019ve come to expect as pub food. The staff is the best in town! You're reading this review, which means you are thinking about going here. Yes, you do. Rachel is an amazing bartender, the Guinness pours were proper, and the Irish breakfast with the black & white pudding is spot on. Shout out to Jody, and her baby mini Guinness! Fun tavern for an Irish jam session on a Sunday afternoon! Good drink selection and satisfying food. The corned beef reuben with fries was fresh, filling, and delicious. The flavors of the meat and dressing were particularly nice.\n\nServers were friendly and cheerful and did a great job taking care of us as well as the musicians. Loved the jaunty and convivial vibes, looking forward to coming back."

Hope my review makes you want to bring your friends or even yourself to this bar truly a gem. I lived in Denver for over a decade and I never went to this bar. Mainly because I am not gay. BIG MISTAKE. We went here on my last night in Denver, and it was EPIC. There was a lurker who was eavesdropping and wouldn't leave at last call, and the bartender brought out OFFICER BAT and chased them out. My bartender friend from LA was overjoyed and laughed his ass off. Truly a great night. Would go back. 10/10. THE BEST PLACE TO DO KARAOKE IN DENVER!!! THE DJ IS UHHHMAZING!!!! The servers truly work as a team...there's no, \"sorry this isn't my table\" BS here! Loved that! Spacious restrooms. Great feel overall!! Highly recommend. Saw the DJ sanitizing the microphone in between each performer! If you like singing out loud!! Get your ass here on Saturday and Wednesday evenings!! Stopped in one night and came back another time for spaghetti dinner for around $10 because why not? Have been a few times since as well. Cool space to grab a drink and get some food. Atmosphere is great and so are the people. Service and food are good as well but can take a bit sometimes. If I had to rank places to get stuck during a Thunder/hail storm, The Owl Saloon is not a bad place.\nVery reasonably priced beers, service was great if you were at the bar, okay if you were at the tables. (Servers & bartenders were all very nice, just busy so you had to wait for cold beers if you were at a table)\nTater tots were good. I thought the Chicago dog was mediocre, but that\u2019s okay, overall it was a great experience and the bathrooms had lots of mirrors for high quality selfies.\nPS, take mystery shots"

One of the best burgers I've had in Denver. Highly recommend the food here! Some of the round tables were comically small and staff delayed to attend us at first, but once we were assigned a waitress, service was efficient and quick! Would come back again."

We were greeted with a warm welcome from our server Gigi and everything was perfect from there on out.\n\nGigi guided us through the menu when we had questions about dishes we were unfamiliar with and she made our delicious martinis perfectly.\n\nWe got a few appetizers, two entrees, and baklava for dessert and every single item was absolutely divine.\n\nGigi had such a warm energy about her and she made us feel like we were dining in her own home.\n\nI highly recommend this restaurant for not only their delicious food but also their wonderful service.\n\nWe will definitely be back! Definitely a spot to visit if you're in the area. I had the Sultan combo and it was amazing! You also get pretty large portions for the price so the plate was able to feed me for 3 more meals. The pita bread was divine. Freshly made, warm, and fluffy. For dessert was baklava and Lebanese coffee which i recommend as a great pick me up to the end of the day. The staff was also lovely and friendly. We had Lori as our server and she was amazing. Answered all our questions, gave helpful suggestions, and checked in on us periodically. I'll definitely be coming back. One of my favorite places in Denver. Everything from the food to the service is exceptional. After our first visit to PK, my partner and I have been talking about how much we want to go back. The owner is lovely! If you haven't been here before, you're missing out! I watched my friend order from here and it was truly a horrific experience to witness. I watched this man GAG on discord eating  this... can I even call it food? It was like watching a grown man eat slop from a sewer. I do NOT advise ordering from here as you will most likely violently vomit an unfathomable amount. DO NOT be deceived by the kind middle eastern man... Phoenician Kabob has always been one of our favorite neighborhood restaurants but after our dinner last night, it is now our favorite. The new chef is amazing! Everything we tried was outstanding. We are eager to go back and try more of her family inspired recipes. My husband and I are very picky - we highly recommend this restaurant!"

    "reviews": "Didn\u2019t eat here. Don\u2019t know that I\u2019d even consider eating here if they served food. The bartender was cool and was very accommodating so kudos to him, actually the best thing about the place. The place allows dogs inside (which is no problem) but they put paws on the bar counters and other things that I feel is a bit out of line for a business to consider acceptable. I understand this is Denver but it\u2019s also a bar and I don\u2019t want to keep your dog occupied while you drink. I want to drink without your dog in my face with his paws on the bar. No thanks, I\u2019ll pass on this place next time I love this bar! Great place to watch the Eagle's game. Very welcoming and rowdy! I've missed something like this since coming to Denver! Feels like home! Everyone at the bar had exceptional service. Love \u2018em and would always recommend this place for a good drink and vibe.\n\nThe Super Bowl DJ put his crappy EDM on blast but couldn\u2019t bother playing Pulitzer Prize Kenny\u2019s Performance at full volume. Bartenders had to tell him to even play the audio for the halftime. (Mind you, he played Drake\u2019s shitty tracks at full volume. Big yikes.) Jill, the bartender, was friendly and informed us about the bar, having been built in 1939. Reasonably priced drinks and unpretentious. They have karaoke and live bands in backyard. Had my dad's 70th birthday here and everything was amazing!! From the game to the food and the service!! The owner is amazing!! Great spot to watch the Broncos!! The atmosphere is amazing!!"

And everyone else around me seemed to be enjoying their food. I saw some food I want to try next time! \ud83d\ude1c The service was excellent, despite our large group! Cheerful, and efficient! And there was a modern JUKE BOX adding so much more enjoyment to the atmosphere! I liked it a LOT!!!\ud83d\ude06 1st time here! It was very good! It was a random Thought to try it. The waiter we had was in training & it was his day 1. So I understand that feeling & pressure of someone new. I feel the environment was pretty , very clean & well taken care of. The workers were friendly. We ordered steak fajitas with a side of rice & beans. A veggie taco salad bowl. & a bean & cheese burrito smothered. Along with chips & salsa. All of the food was amazingly great! The only thing was the veggie salad bowl had spinach in it & I'm not such a fan of that so I had it replaced with the bean burrito. I feel the amount of the food beat out the price. You get a lot of food!! Yummy food!\u00a0 It was very affordable for what we ordered & I feel it would be somewhere I would come back to enjoy another meal! The cooks nailed it today! I came in the morning and they knew exactly what they were doing. I loved my food so much; they put their heart into it and made it the best I could ask for. Thank you I will be coming back and telling my friends about it. Sooo good!!! Best place ever! So I went in here and ordered food worst restaurant ever foods garbage service is garbage  they overcharged me for one and then when I called them on it they decided to kick me out of the restaurant and one of their workers pepper sprayed me I'm in talks with Aurora Police department which is also garbage I will be filing civil complaints and personal litigation against their employee an against all involved Aurora Police department case number ap2024-229478"

    "reviews": "How do you rate a take out that's been in transit for well over 25 minutes.  Well, in this case probably as some of the best I've ever had.\nBlazing Bird has a flavour foundation that is exquisite, being that I'm not huge on super spicy i found the mild to be just enough heat that it didn't melt my taste buds. It arrived pretty darn warm for such a long time in transit and whoever came up with this recipe for fries needs a promotion. I had ordered it simple and decided to have the 3 large tenders in order to get the basic flavour of the chicken and spice.  Spice is not JUST a matter of heat, there was a lovely balance of garlic, sweet, paprika and some other blended spices that i couldn't identify but still very much enjoyed.  The fries, like most commercial ones, are heavily dipped in corn starch but in this case it gives them an edge. When exposed to the outside air after transport they immediately crisped up quite a bit, and made them far better than most \"fresh\" fries I've had in fast food.\nIf I had a complaint it was that the chicken was slightly over done, some parts were just a little dry as a result but overall the entire thing was delicious.  Highly recommended and thank you to the Blazing Bird team for a great delivery meal. This was fine. It wasn't really worth me running to buy a sandwich before closing, it was just a decent chicken sandwich in my opinion. Still fully enjoyed it though. Bomb! I don't know why I waited so long to try this !! The blazing load is my go-to, which comes with Mac & Cheese, Fries, Slice Jumbo Tenders, Pickles, and Come back ( Add Slaw) if you like. I guarantee it will not disappoint you. Their loaded fries and blazing mac are also fire, if you don't wanna have it mixed up. I recommend giving this place a try if you're craving some bomb chicken with some bomb sauce!! So glad we found this gem. The fried chicken was on point! It was very flavorful and the fries were also yummy. The chocolate cream shake is a MUST! Will be back many more times...I'm sure! Solid 3 stars\u2014but only because of the prices.\nIf you\u2019re a fan of chicken, they\u2019re definitely worth checking out. The food wasn\u2019t dry or overcooked like you get at a lot of chicken spots. Everything was flavorful, tender, and cooked well. I\u2019ll definitely be back.\n\nWe tried the macaroni bowls and the tacos and ate inside. The dining area is small\u2014there are seats, but if you\u2019re claustrophobic or self-conscious about people watching you eat, just be aware the whole setup is pretty open. Wherever you sit, you can see the front and the front can see you. But they had nice tables and even had a baby seat for my daughter, which I appreciated.\n\nThe food came out fairly quickly, not super fast, but not a long wait either. One small issue: the guy messed up my order, and instead of correcting it, he just had my friend give me his pickles\u2014which kind of annoyed me, but it\u2019s my friend so I let it slide.\n\nOverall, everything tasted really good. I just can\u2019t justify giving more than 3 stars because of the pricing, but I\u2019ll definitely be back."

It is also located near the Veterans hospital.\n\nI enjoyed the food and the environment. 5/5 will come back here again. It is a great deal for those who are price conscious. Delicious, authentic Mexican food.  Great flavors, inexpensive, almost all Spanish speaking customers.  Breakfast tacos were delicious as was the skillet and the combination plate.  This is a popular spot on a Sunday morning.  Highly recommend! Really tasty food. I got the Huevos Divorciarse which was great and unique and she got the tamales. The staff were very nice and helpful. Also their menu is quite option packed with breakfast served all day. The next time we are over on that side of town, we'll be back! Recommend giving them a shot if you haven't. Frozen meals , taste is watered down, enchiladas were disgusting very strange red sauce tasted old. My daughters Chimichanga had watery juice in it. Gag me\nNo prices on menu ,oh ok?!. And this was Mother's  day when we went. Oh but the servers have skin tight jeans on ,that matters!!! As if."

I was told very rudely by the girl who took my money, that the salads are made fresh in the morning and I can not ask for no tomatoes. I pulled forward and asked the person handing out the food why they couldn't make a fresh salad for me with no tomatoes. The lady taking the cash came over asking what does she want now?? I explained it was simply asking  why a salad minus tomatoes couldn't be made.i asked what if I am allergic?? Miss cash chick told me...Well guess you better order something else then... really??7 This is one of the locations that is usually on point whenever I visit.  They usually have fresh ingredients and good service.  This location & and the location off of I-70 & Chambers usually stay on point. So check em out if you\u2019re ever in the neighborhood and holla at a Playa \ud83d\udc4c\ud83c\udffe I wanted to use the bathroom before placing my order so my food doesn't get cold but (MANAGER BRENDA) forced me to pay for my food first so it can be cold after my bathroom visit. After I buy my food she let in bunch of people us it, so I just took my food and left. I will NEVER come here again!!!! So I came to Wendy\u2019s today with an appetite but lost it very quickly once I came in. I asked the manager on duty Brenda if I could use the bathroom I explained that I am a paying customer that I just needed to use the bathroom before I ordered because it was an emergency she told me that I needed to pay first and than she would give me the code to the restroom. As I quickly lost my appetite I still ordered a drink , even tho I ordered a drink the drink machine was down after that she still didn\u2019t want to give me the code but came and opened the door so I could use it after being very rude to me. All the tables are dirty it\u2019s no where to even sit not to even mention the whole drink machine is down so I paid for something I can\u2019t even receive , I\u2019m also a manager at a 7-11 so I know how customers should be treated and she treated me very poorly but I watched her be nice to the customers before me. Sounds to me like Ms Brenda needs a little more training on how to be a manager and treat their customers , I understand that this might be a tough location but I\u2019m not homeless or a bum so to be treated as such , I will never come back to this location. I would like to speak to an area leader or someone above her to express this concern and how you can lose loyal customers by the way you treat people. Customer service should always be 100% and not slacking. I will not be back here, This Wendy's has very cool staff working there very friendly.i was trying to get 2 frostys but was short like a dollar she still hooked us up with the 2 very Cool \ud83d\ude0e"

It comes with what I would consider a large container of consomm\u00e9 which is incredibly well spiced, had extra chunks of beef, and is amongst the best that I have had.  The steak tacos were good as well and came with a solid green salsa.  Can\u2019t wait to come back for some al pastor tacos! I came across the place randomly one day. There were flyers posted on the lawn and decided to go check it out. As soon as you get there, you can smell the smoked chicken and turkey legs. It was divine! The first time, I got the birriatacos, and the husband got the tripa (intestines) Taco and a Carne asada plate. I don't like tripe, but man, these were cleaned really well and had a nice crispy texture. The consome that came with the birriatacos was very flavorful, I could've just eaten a whole bowl of that. Second round, I got the chicken tacos, my husband got tripa tacos again, and a grilled turkey leg to go. The chicken tacos were from the grill. The chicken was juicy and had some yummy burnt bits. The turkey leg, wow! That was incredible. I would come to this place over and over again! Some of the best pastor tacos I\u2019ve had in a while. The plate was packed with meat and the salsas are flavorful and spicy. The price is pretty good considering the amount of food you get. I will be coming back! Pastor cheese tacos were outstanding. I'm gonna say they were the best tacos I've ever had. I continue to come here over and over and the food is amazing, the people are great and even accommodate my lack of Spanish speaking, I have called them just to find out where they are, they are back at LA Plaza!!"

    "reviews": "Last night\u2019s dinner order was a bummer. My husband and I have dinner here (or take out, like last night) often. I always order the buffalo chicken wrap with onion rings, it\u2019s always perfect (and huge!) I\u2019m not sure if there\u2019s a new cook or if it was just a bad night but there was barely any lettuce or cheese and no tomatoes. It was basically all chicken - don\u2019t get me wrong, the extra protein was okay\u2026 but I wanted it how it\u2019s always made. To top it off, I usually LOVE their onion rings, but I was literally able to wring out the oil from them, it was so gross and disappointing.\n\nMy husband ordered a chicken burrito (which he never had from here) and was so disappointed. Zero seasoning on the chicken and nothing else inside the burrito. He also wasn\u2019t thrilled about the side of beans.\n\nI\u2019m hoping this was just a one off, at least for the wrap.\n\nStaff is always friendly. It can be hard to grab their attention when it\u2019s a busy night but that\u2019s to be expected. What an awesome little spot. As I travel around the US I strive to find spots just like this. Good food, i had the prime rib sandwich as suggested and it did not disappoint. The beer was good and cold the staff was friendly and the band was phenomenal. Will be back, see y\u2019all soon!! Love this place! Great service, prices, and atmosphere. It\u2019d be perfect with a more varied menu\u2014especially seafood options\u2014and improved parking. Hope to see these upgrades soon! Great local joint only about 10 minutes from hotel row. Friendly folks, a full bar, fun, and affordable prices. The staff was all really nice and the owners were also tremendously respectful. Thank you. Great food, burgers, fries and onion ring are really good! Giving 4/5 stars because of service. Could be better, server wasn\u2019t great.."

    "reviews": "This was our first visit to Ester\u2019s and we enjoyed it. We each had the lunch special with Caesar salad. I had cheese pizza which I found to be, oddly, very salty. It was weird but not enough to not eat it. Parmesan sanded to help a bit. Salads were good, hubby\u2019s pepperoni and mushroom pizza was good. Everything was pretty clean, including the loo. It\u2019s a big place with outdoor seating and it\u2019s all accessible. I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll be back. Great patio, great service, very good food. Their pizzas are generous and made with great ingredients. I live about 5 minutes away from Esters and always drove by it thinking \"I should really try that place out\". It was not until yesterday when a friend of mine mentioned that they really enjoyed it that I pulled the trigger and finally checked it out (reviews and recommendations really do work!) and I am so glad I did.\n\nAt first glance, it may look like Esters is just a typical bar with average bar food but I was pleasantly proved wrong. The food was excellent and portioned well for the price. I especially enjoyed the Italian Chopped salad. It was huge and very generous on all toppings. The cocktail was mixed well with good proportions.\n\nThe service was on point during the entire visit. I don't think I ever had to wait too long for anything. No complaints here!\n\nThe last point I want to touch on which is HUGE for me is how clean everything was. From the entrance (which is beautifully decorated by the way) to the bathrooms, everything was immaculate. Huge thumbs up on the clearly visible and immaculate kitchen also on the way to the bathrooms. I always love it when restaurants show off their kitchens!\n\nI will definitely be checking this place out again maybe when there's a sporting event I want to watch. Esters has definitely become my absolute new favorite pizza place! This restaurant has truly blown everyone else out of the water. I fell in love with the vibrancy of this entire environment - from the staff, to the amazing decor to the absolutely perfect and delicious food. Whoever designed and decorated this place deserves a medal! And whoever created this menu, makes the food and serves it - deserves a medal. I am truly so thankful to have visited this location. The service was amazing, the food and drinks were amazing and I loved our outdoor seats under the covered patio. I highly recommend trying the gluten free pizza, the gluten free hot wings, the country club on gluten free bread with the fruit bowl and the gluten free carrot cake (HUGE AND SO, SO TASTY). Their old-fashioned is also excellent! Overall, if I could rate this place higher than a five, I truly would. I am definitely recommending this place to anyone and everyone I know. Service was great, and the gluten free pizza is delicious!! They let you do half and half of different types of pizzas on one which I thought was awesome. Highly recommend this spot. Thank you for having a delicious gluten free dough!"

I really like the neighborhood feel of this establishment, it's a great spot for locals. The staff is also friendly and attentive! Unfortunately the food wasn't anything to write home about.

A little overpriced as they automatically add an 18% gratuity with no table service and expect you to bus your own table but still good! Good vibes if you sit outside! I absolutely love taking my dog to Edgewater beer garden! Not only are their beer selections amazing (the ratio carrot beer is a fav of mine) but their food is amazing + they have a dog friendly menu for a fun, special treat. Such a wide open space with great selection of food and beverages! They said they are dog friendly as long as the \u201cgarage hanger\u201d doors are open. Meaning dogs can be inside during those times. They have a ton of outdoor space - lots of standing room and picnic tables with plenty of shade.\n\nWe were there when an event had rented out a big patio area and there was still tons of room for regular seating.\n\nThe menu is clear and easy to navigate as an allergy person. They have great salads and you can add a variety of protein to them.\n\nAwesome spot to hang out - the only major issue is parking. Definitely plan to park a few streets over and walk, or maybe bike there? A really cool spot that is consistently busy. What I love: the variety in alcoholic and NA drinks, all the different food options, how dog friendly the patio is, the neighborhood vibes. What I don't love: the drink prices and all the food except the tacos! So, stick to the tacos if you get food! The other items I've tried are quite bland. It's overall a fun place to meet up with friends. Lots of kids and families as well. Just stopped by on my way to catch a flight home and this place was perfect! The atmosphere, service and quality of food is exceptional!"

Than when I thought he noticed me , he walks past me not acknowledging I'm there to grab his buddy another drink. It was not until I spoke that I was acknowledged, and respond annoyed that I was there to spend my money. Not to mention they werent by any means busy. Don't try to call ahead either they won't answer. Had been told of this place a few times and it lived up to the hype. Watched the Kentucky Derby and the two Game 7s yesterday and had an absolute blast. It has the feel of a fun dive/sports bar, great drinks and awesome service! This bar is and it's staff is so fun and on point. Great atmosphere,  great seevice, great people, great vibes!! Great neighborhood spot with kick ass brand new tvs. Great sports bar! Good food too. They have a bunch of infusion flavors and all you can eat tacos on Tuesdays and all you can eat wings on Thursdays! Sloans lake view too! Like I said good vibes \u2764\ufe0f Service was incredible, atmosphere was so fun. Beer pong, table games, great wings, great music and huge tv screens for the game. 10/10 will come back for most sports games I love this place \u2764\ufe0f  Tbe vibes are immaculate!

They\u2019ve got awesome weekly specials that keep things fresh and give you a reason to come back regularly.\n\nI also really enjoy the English pub vibe\u2014feels cozy and authentic, and the dart board is a fun touch that adds to the charm. Plus, the views overlooking Sloan Lake are just fantastic. Great food, great atmosphere, and a great spot to relax. Highly recommend! I was in town from San Antonio and gave it a try. Delicious and not greasy authentic fish and chips. I also had the meat pie and it was great also . Weather permitting you can sit outside and get a great view of Sloan lake and take a stroll around after you are done eating. A nice hidden gem in Denver, I got the combination meal with cod, pollock, prawn, squid, and scallop and everything was so perfect and filling. Everyone was very welcoming and kind and the person with pink hair was so nice and gave excellent customer service. Awesome place! The boxes are so cute Went here a year or so ago and had a much better experience then last night\u2019s take away.  Had family in town from England and I\u2019m afraid that this time (and we ordered a bunch) the sausage rolls were underdone, the fish was so heavily battered on small bits or fish. The cornish pasty was under cooked. Very greasy, because of so much batter we ended up pulling it all off. Disappointed for the premium price, sorry.\n\nI put the sausage rolls and pies in the oven at home for 10min and finished them off and they were nice. Saving grace was that the pork pie was excellent. Atmosphere is simple casual, clean, small self-serve fish restaurant. Has a descent sized full bar. It's one of my favorite places to go solo, I feel comfortable, safe, and love to lookout across Sheridan Blvd at #SloansLake .I love their battered cod (Fish & Chips) love this place. Great service, it's a small place w/ 1 person who doubles as the bartender & cashier. Although, it gets a bit-busy at times...it's well worth the small wait time."

Their menu offers a variety of options, and I particularly enjoy their creative twists on classic dishes. The staff is always welcoming and attentive, making each visit a pleasant experience. Whether I\u2019m catching up with friends or enjoying a solo meal, Rupert\u2019s provides a warm and inviting atmosphere that keeps me coming back. Outdoor seating gives you a great view of the lake and city behind. Staff were quick, helpful and nice. They even allowed us to move as we had our cat,who was on a leash, to another spot where we would cause any issues for other tables and those with dogs. Classic breakfast diner options. The inhouse made pimento cheese burger was really  good. We enjoyed a quick and delicious breakfast. We had a wonderful breakfast at Rupert\u2019s at the Edge! The highlight of the meal was the creamy Smoked Gouda Grits\u2014rich, velvety, and absolutely unforgettable.\n\nOur table also enjoyed the Bountiful Veggie Benedict, featuring perfectly poached eggs, fresh vegetables, and a silky hollandaise sauce. The Heirloom Potato Hash was cooked beautifully, though we found it could use a touch more seasoning. For a lighter option, the egg-white frittata with a crisp side salad was a great choice\u2014simple yet flavorful.\n\nThe cozy atmosphere and friendly service made the experience even better. If you\u2019re in the area, don\u2019t miss out on this breakfast spot. We\u2019ll definitely return for those grits! This place was pretty disappointing. The food was mediocre and expensive for the quality. The biggest issue- Two of the three employees we interacted with were visibly and audibly sick, with other employees nearby also sounding like they had the same cold/flu. One employee was even talking to other staff members about his wife being super sick at home. Thankfully our primary server was the one employee who didn\u2019t sound sick, and she was friendly.\n\nThe cinnamon roll and potato pancakes were pretty tasty. Food came out fast but it was also pretty dead for a Sunday morning which was probably good considering the entire staff looked like they were on the brink. The breakfast sandwich was run of the mill. The Benedict was sad, just two little egg pucks with a little hollandaise on a low quality muffin. Super disappointing especially for $15.\n\nOverall, experience would\u2019ve just been mediocre and wouldn\u2019t have warranted a review but the staff being clearly sick and handling our food just really put me off. Happy, fun place with delicious food and drinks.\n\nHighly rated and its all that, people.\n\nVery friendly waitstaff...cool spot right across from Sloans Lake."

    "reviews": "Hands down the best Thai spot in Denver. Not only is it the only place that when I order Thai hot, I actually get Thai hot that makes me sweat, but they are consistent in flavor. Great price point, great flavor, great service, and great consistency. Can't ask for more. WOW! Some of the best thai food I've ever had in Denver. Great spice levels, great flavor, nicely cooked chicken. Egg rolls were perfectly crisp and super yummy. Loved our meal and affordable price! Love love love this place for excellent Thai food. Found this place 7-8 years ago and try to hit it up every time we are in the area (moved up to northern CO). Beware, the hot scale is legit. Medium is a builder and will scratch your ass if you're not a seasoned heatonist. Only about 25 seats available for dine in. Enjoy! The best Thai food in all of Denver. Egg rolls and chicken satay are the best in Denver. It\u2019s the only place I can find a thick egg roll,  not the thin weak egg rolls you get everyone else. Love their drunken noodles, but have never had anything from here that was delicious. Service is always so friendly. Atmosphere is just meh, but it\u2019s nice that they have indoor and outdoor dining options, and the service is always fast and friendly. Follow the warning on the menu about the spice level. I enjoy spicy food, but the mild plus is plenty of spice for me. I\u2019ve tried medium before and it was hard to eat and even the mild plus makes my nose run. They are the BEST!\nTheir hot is actually hot. They're one of the few places that actually makes a fresh WIDE noodle! Pad see ew & drunken noodles taste even better with a perfectly flat and wide noodle- can't be thin! They do it best!\n\nThey also get their wok SEARING HOT! So you get the smoking wok taste that is essential in a wok Thai noodle!\n\nTheir crab cheese wontons are one of our favorites in town- the golden ratio of cheese and crispy exterior. They fold it lucky money bag style too!\n\nUS Thai is a staple."

    "reviews": "What a gem in NW Denver! This brand-new venue connected to the iconic Edgewater Inn, is quickly becoming a must-visit spot for live music lovers or anyone looking for a cocktail with a side of entertainment. With performances from fantastic local and touring acts several nights a week, there's always something exciting happening!\n\nWe've stopped by a couple of times and caught their Thursday karaoke night. While I'm not usually a big karaoke fan, the fun, welcoming crowd completely won me over!\n\nIf you're nostalgic for the good vibes of Local 46 on Tennyson, this spot\u2014with its lively bar and dog-friendly outdoor beer garden\u2014feels like home. Bonus: you can grab a delicious slice or a meal from the Edgewater Inn kitchen, since it\u2019s all part of the same fantastic operation. Highly recommend! The best of the best for energy, staff, atmosphere, and patrons; this is the only restaurant/bar staff that made me feel like I had my own personal Cheers bar, was and will always be my \u201cthird place\u201d.\nI love you all, so deeply, I appreciate you, literally just being there, through all the years. You have made my heart feel SO FULL, when it came in so empty. \ud83e\udef6\nThank you. \ud83e\udd0d Obsessssed! This is such a cute hidden divey bar with great events, great energy, and great cocktails. They even have a pool table and what looks like really yummy bar food that I'm looking forward to trying. Their Tuesday local jam is my absolute favorite with talented local musicians playing great music together. Such a fun night when I stumbled upon this bar and the perfect spot for live music, karaoke, and a good time. Great venue for music, pizza, beer and also has a big outdoor patio area that seats bigger groups. Cute neighborhood spot and you have to hear the story of the connection and meaning of the number 46, if you don't know it! \u2764\ufe0f Let\u2019s get a scanner in here folks!\n\nI get that y\u2019all aren\u2019t well traveled but my ID was not accepted solely because your bartenders have evidently never left Colorado.\n\nFelt marginalized and excluded because of my homeland!\n\n#livefreeordie"

    "reviews": "This place is absolutely delicious. I love fries and order them at almost every restaurant.. these fries were top 3 out of anywhere I\u2019ve gone. So crispy without the grease that usually can accompany them. The fried chicken sandwich (I opted for Nashville style) was spicy yet sweet because of some sort of honey they also put on it. I am 100% coming back here and I hope if you\u2019re reading this review you will come here and try it for yourself! My first time at Briar Common. I will be back and back again. From the minute we walked in the door we were welcomed with big smile and  a table instantly. I had the fish and chips and friend had Ahi Tuna salad. Both were over the top delicious. Last, but certainly not least, Patrick was awesome. Great service!! Thank you so much for a great experience! We absolutely love Briar Common, don\u2019t get us wrong. But when the restaurant is barely full and TWO LOUD WOMEN AT THE BAR are generating enough volume to fill the entire restaurant, yeah that\u2019s terrible. And the bartenders need to quit encouraging it.\n\nI get this sounds like a \u201cKaren\u201d review, but it shouldn\u2019t. If you\u2019re going to brunch, you don\u2019t want to pay money and not even be able to hear your own conversation because of TWO people. The other tables around us were equally annoyed and left, just like we did, because of them.\n\nGross. Only had a pretzel with beer cheese to eat. Quick service in a great atmosphere. Everyone seemed to be having fun and enjoying the place. Didn't get to try the rooftop area, will try to go back for that later. Tried several beers with our group enjoyed them all. Made it back to sit outside on the rooftop. Great view of the park and had great service again. The food here is surprisingly good but the beer is even better. Highly recommended if you are in the area."

    "reviews": "I really loved this place. It had a nice pub feel. Our waiter was super friendly the food was amazing and the atmosphere gives you the I can relax play cards or just hang out. The other nice this was that parking is right around back, and the location is easy to get to. I had the juicy Lucy, which had some deep flavors. However, I got a bite of the vampire burger with garlic butter and roasted garlic chips. That would be the burger i get next time man it was delicious,  so flavorful and the buns had a hint if sweet to really tie it all together. I went to the Federal Bar and Grill because I saw online that they have GF fish and chips. Most of their menu is GF. My server Emily asked if I had any allergies when I ordered, and it was quickly served. There were 4 chunks of GF beer battered cod fillets on a bed of fresh French fries and garnishes with paprika. The tartar sauce is homemade. The fish was light, crunchy, and perfectly cooked. It was not greasy, and I really enjoyed it. Emily was a wonderful server and very friendly. I definitely recommend. I LOVE this restaurant! I\u2019m 100% gluten free and so it majority of the menu, so it\u2019s very refreshing to have a safe place to eat with good food! I always get a regular cheese burger on a gluten free bun with fries, and I\u2019m OBSESSED with the loaded potato skins\u2026 so good!! My boyfriend loves the sweet potato fries and the BBQ pulled pork sandwich as well. Staff have always been pleasant and welcoming as well! Super food, super staff, super fast!\nNice atmosphere. If I would be in this area any longer, this bar would definitely see me again!\n\nHighly recommended for gluten free diet. This was such a nice surprise find. The veggie taco was so amazing. The chicken taco was also tasty but I will return for the veggie taco the next time I am in the area. The restaurant is clean, the atmosphere was great (casual and chill while I was there). I look forward to trying more of the food next time. The staff was friendly and the parking was easy to find in the lot next door."

Nice employees \ud83e\udd17\ud83e\udd1e Good variety of good beers. Empanada food truck when I was there.\nThere's a Mystery vending machine.\nBig bar area, lots of seating inside, outdoor seating, some games available, TV showing 90s American Gladiators and Baywatch.\nI would return. This brewery embodies what Colorado craft brewing is all about. Little Machine makes great beer and doesn\u2019t take itself too seriously in the process. Go here for a great atmosphere, welcoming staff, and some of the best craft beer in the Front Range Little Machine is my go to brewery.  The staff is excellent and makes you feel right at home.  I bring all my friends here both from in and out of town.  We enjoy the outside patio, beers, food trucks and overall friendly/welcoming environment.  I moved out of the neighborhood and still find my way back \"home\" very often! Great place, great beers, even better people! Nice little brewery near Mile High Stadium, #LittleMachineBeer hit the spot for some nice cold pours. Great indoor and outdoor areas to sit and enjoy your thirst! Nicely filled selection of rotating flavors along with surely regularly offered brews here. A few light munchy snacks offered here as well as some non-alcoholic. Cold, friendly pours here by the staff. Loved the road-soda cans available too. Definitely a nice stop if you're in Denver, looking for a good local fresh brew!"

    "reviews": "Your standard neighborhood sports bar. The beer on tap was pretty good, the bar tenders were really nice. Went on a Saturday and it was packed with sports fans. The tvs were a bit loud but there was a game on and people were into it. Also, out door area as well which is nice if you want to get away from the noise inside. Stopped by for a quick drink on our way to dinner. Everyone was friendly and talkative. Will be back to try some pretzels next time we are in town! Came here around 9 pm on a regular summer Saturday night. There was live music and a lively crowd already a drink deep in the cozy place.\n\nThe crowd was mostly older 20s/young 30s being well mannered and sociable. The drink list was solid, I got a jalapeno mule ($8) which hit the spot.\n\nThe ambiance was welcoming. Not a dive bar, not too upscale, with good low lighting, brick, and four TVs playing muted sports. There is a small outdoor area as well.\n\nHighly recommend for solo or friends out for social hour. Great vibe and cool location! We are so grateful for Sara and her team's extraordinary service to the residents of Skyline at Highlands when they hosted a resident happy hour for us last week.  The warmth and hospitality provided by the staff at JPP make this a wonderful neighborhood gathering place."

    "reviews": "A sophisticated dining destination offering innovative dishes and stunning views of the city. This is now our third time here and we always try to give it another chance, that's come to an end. Overall, the restaurant is clean and the atmosphere is great. However, the service is terrible. The people are friendly but our server tonight had over 9 tables. We asked for a refill on water and it never came. We got up and got our own. The staff have zero clue what their table numbers were as we were asked 2 times if we ordered drinks, we didn't. It took 25 minutes for a side salad served on a paper plate. The 14 dollar pizza has 2 splats of cheese on it and 4 pepperoni on it, terrible. Not what I expected from a $14 dollar pizza. The food overall was below average. When we didn't see our server again until we tracked her down for our check. She then just asked for the credit card and she would run it without us seeing the bill. Needless to say, we wont be returning. Worst service ever. I get that I'm here for a special event, but our table would have easily spend twice the money, in both food and drinks, if we had service at all. I got my first drink (and only) in good time, which is why I didn't rate only 1 star, but I would have loved food from here too. 45 minutes later, we FINALLY got someone to check in on us briefly, and by then, on principle alone, I waited to get food from somewhere else. This was the worst service I've ever experienced.\n\nUpdate: even after an hour and a a half, we still haven't even gotten more water. I had to grab 2 bottles for our table of 6 on my own. The food was great. Loved the buffet option and for $25 it was a good price. The service however wasn't great. Turns out there was a shift in ownership, and most people who had been working there were not able to keep their jobs so they were severely understaffed. A heads up would've been great but I'll probably still head back during the basketball season. This is a buffet. Food is typically cold. We have ate here several times. Tupicallyvabout $25 per person during a playoff game price goes up to $40 per person. Nothing spectacular about the food. Several choices but it\u2019s not a $40 or even $25 meal. We wish we had ate at the Land Rover club much cheaper."

    "reviews": "Unfortunately, my experience at this restaurant was far from enjoyable. I came in with a small group, expecting a good meal and a welcoming atmosphere, but what we encountered was anything but that. From the start, Matt, the manager, was noticeably rude and dismissive. He made sarcastic and condescending remarks about my intelligence and seemed irritated that we brought a party into the restaurant \u2014 which was strange, considering that\u2019s the kind of business restaurants rely on.\n\nWhat made the situation even more uncomfortable was Matt\u2019s behavior during and after his so-called apology. He approached me smelling strongly of alcohol, which was immediately concerning, especially for someone in a management position. He got uncomfortably close to me under the pretense of shaking my hand \u2014 but then wouldn\u2019t let go. While holding onto my hand, he leaned in and whispered in my ear, saying that he would \u201cmake sure me and my party are taken care of.\u201d The whole interaction felt incredibly inappropriate and unsettling.\n\nThis is not how guests should be treated, and it\u2019s certainly not the kind of environment I would recommend to anyone. A manager should set the tone for professionalism and hospitality, not make customers feel uncomfortable or disrespected. I hope this feedback is taken seriously, because the behavior I experienced was unacceptable.\nmy party and I did not stay after this altercation we took our business further into the city. What a great place to pre-game before an event at Ball Arena! Service, beer, food, and location are all exemplary. And to boot, prices are fair (a lot better than anything you are gonna get inside the arena). Food was ok bar food.\nOur server was decent.\nOwner has put $0 in to the TV\u2019s in over a decade.  They are all the size of a computer screen. Great place to eat. Our waitress Renee did a fabulous job! She made us feel welcome and took great care of us. She provided great service and knowledge and efficiency.  The food came very quickly and was delicious. Perfect place to eat right across from the Ball Arena before your game. Nice enough atmosphere. We've been here many times before games & concerts. But honestly,  the food is pretty sub par. And while the servers are always friendly & try to do their best, they always seem to be understaffed, so service tends to be slow. Can't imagine why we'd ever go here if it wasn't for the great location right next to the Ball arena."

The food was delicious and honestly I wish I had taken more pictures of our dinner because the presentation of each dish was beautiful but it was so good it got devoured too quickly. They set the ambiance with beautiful table decor, making it feel romantic. When we initially got sat by some excited children (cause who wouldn't be excited at the aquarium?!) they happily moved us to a more private table to ourselves. We had Natalie as our server, and she was so charismatic and attentive. She checked in on us periodically, gave us a great wine selection, and made sure our stay was comfortable. It's definitely a great stop if you're hungry while at the aquarium. I'd recommend getting a reservation though, just to hold your table because it gets pretty busy very quickly. We had a reservation and still ended up waiting about 20 minutes after arriving to be seated.\n\nThe food was delicious! Our waitress was very friendly and checked on us just the right amount of times.\n\nIt's an aquarium so it does smell heavy however the food and drinks made you forget about it.\n\nYou can take certain drinks home in a souvenir cup as well as see all the cool fish swim by you as you eat!\n\nIt's a very neat place to check out! We decided to make a reservation here for Mother\u2019s Day Brunch. Our waitress Brisaidy was absolutely amazing! She constantly checked up on us and made sure we were taken care of. She was extremely friendly and personable which made our Mother\u2019s Day brunch even better! The food was also SO GOOD. The roast beef was a favorite at our table as well as the toffee cookies! We are definitely coming back! Natalie was great! She helped a large party of 8 and got us all taken care of. The food was great and the kids were happy. They loved being able to see the fish while they ate. Highly recommended. We came here tonight for my daughters birthday and it was our first time. We were excited to try it!unfortunately we were extremely disappointed me and my daughter had the blackened fish tacos..... they looked great the rice was so hard the fork would break a big chunk of it and the beans were definitely old. Tortillas ripped as soon as u grabbed the taco and the the fish tacos were super dry. My husband got the Cajun chicken and shrimp pasta came out and was not warm.... the mermaid show and the service was great but they are very expensive for giving u hard rice and super dry tacos..."

Great hidden spot inside Ball Arena. Food is good, beer selection is great, the staff is awesome. We went before April 11th Nuggets game. Our waitress was fantastic. Unfortunately, I don\u2019t remember her name. She brought me a complimentary cookies and ice cream. We\u2019re headed back tonight before Nuggets playoff game. The Argus security staff is horrible. Restaraunt staff is great but the Security is horrible. My friend (57 year old) accidentally walked in with a knife and was asked to throw it away. He did not and walked out and I arrived and gave the knife to my wife who dropped me off and we proceeded in. The metal detector did not go off for my friend yet they asked him to step aside and aggressively searched him and clearly found nothing. The supervisor then proceed to harass me and my friend and threatened to remove us and do whatever he could to not let us into the game. Really pour supervisor for such an elder man who should be mature. We were not informed the restaurant would be closing within 45 minutes of when we were sat. The server placed the check on our table with full plates of food. She continued to come by so we put our credit cards in only to be hustled out by multiple staff members immediately after paying, in my opinion, in an aggressive manner. I couldn't even go to the bathroom in peace. I've never experienced service like this. Bad!"

    "reviews": "I already decided to come here before get out my trip. The restaurant is far more larger and fancy than I expected, and the service is very nice. Food is excellent.. The happy hour food and drinks are awesome, when I and my friend are enjoying the moment, the restaurant set up a big dessert to celebrate my birthday. Wow! what a remarkable moment. Thanks a lot!\nBy the way, it\u2019s a very good deal to join their member , the restaurant will send promotional or update activity information. After having more than one friend recommend this spot, I decided to head down here for dinner on Sunday evening.  We had a reservation for 4:15, which was just around the time the Nuggets playoff game was ending. The restaurant was fairly loud and it was hard to have a conversation with the person across from me.  After a little bit of time the spot eventually cleared out and it became a little more manageable.\n\nWe were seated quickly, however it took our server a few minutes to get to us.  We started with the spicy fried chicken sliders, which were good, not very spicy.  A small chicken tender on a piece of bread but had good flavor, 6.5/10.  We decided to split a southwest smoked chicken salad, which for $20 was a fairly smaller salad.  I found the chicken to tasted like it had been made a day or two before. All in all a 7/10.  For entrees we had the cheeseburger, this was very good, great amount of flavor and cooked well 8.5/10.  The fries were pretty good, I found that some were cooked better than others, but an 8.1/10 on the fries. I don't know why I decided to get it but I went for the grilled ribeye steak, it claimed to be 12oz and seasoned with their rub, but there was no seasoning or garlic butter as they claim. The steak was a very thin piece of steak and it was overcooked and tasteless 1.9/10.  I had the server talk me into adding shrimp to this, this was another mistake, 4 over cooked, tasteless shrimp, no seasoning, all you could taste was the charcoal from the grill 1/10.  The asparagus turned out to be one of the better items on the plate 6/10.\n\nIt was hard to find any street parking. We ended up in the parking garage behind the restaurant, which was $15.  I would say for our $130 meal (including tip) for two of us, there are a lot better option in town. If you are going to eat here, try some of the other dishes. A lot of the food that passed us looked pretty good. I may come back for a burger, but not any time soon. Great music, atmosphere, and service. I think it\u2019s a little odd to \u201cofficially\u201d introduce yourself to patrons and ask their names and then leave a card reminding you what your bartender\u2019s names are BUT maybe that\u2019s just a corporate thing. Prices were high- happy hour was mostly great (well drinks still high regardless.) We were really happy with the food, however, especially the chicken sliders. As a chain, this was solid, and considering the location, I understand paying a bit extra. The food and service is amazing. It was super loud with ppl cheering for their favorite basketball team. It was hard to visit and we only had about a foot between our table and the next couple. If you don't mind the atmosphere go for it. We prefer a bit more quiet and private meal! I enjoyed this place. It was a really nice environment. The staff were friendly, helpful, and went above and beyond to make things right when I found a piece of hair in my fries. I\u2019m understanding enough to know that things happen. The burger was delicious. The fries were good. I also got a IPA in the house for the accident that was also very good. I would definitely go back on my next visit to Denver."

Both have plenty of TVs to watch the sports being shown Solid atmosphere, food and service.  Came for lunch on st pattys day and had a great time.\n\nCorned beef and cabbage was real good.  Wouldn\u2019t have minded a bit more cabbage.\n\nBuddy had the sausage and fries.  Sauce was good, sausage had really good flavor.\n\nWould definitely eat here again.  Portion size was really good. Good place to watch soccer and have a few beers. The day I stopped in they only had one person working the bar and the kitchen was closed. I\u2019ve been a couple of times on weekends for football (soccer) matches and football games, and it\u2019s been great.\n\nGood stuff:\n- Super nice, efficient bartenders.\n- Lots of varied seating.\n- I have not tried the food, but it looks good and reasonable prices.\n- Lots of TVs\n\nA couple of \u201cchallenges\u201d:\n- What they put on their biggest TVs seems random at times. Like golf or someone talking in a studio, while the featured match is on the small screens below it.\n- It\u2019s hard to tell online when they will be open early for special events or early matches that start at 7 am or 9:30 am etc so you just have to wing it.\n- Parking can be tough.\n\nI will definitely stop by from time to time! Just went there because it was close. Turned out to be my best decision in a while. Service was great, food was outstanding, and you can sit at the bar, at a table, or on a large sofa (if you wish). Plenty of decor. I wound up eating 4 different dishes because the first was so amazing. None of them let me down.\n\nBaked Brie in Flake Dough\nSpinach Artichoke Dip\nBangers and Mash\nReuben\n\nAll fantastic."

    "reviews": "The best selection of French dips in downtown Denver. Cute date night spot that is semi casual. We tell everyone to go here when they are visiting to get good eats and nice Denver vibes walking near Milk market Pony Up, a lively bar and restaurant in the heart of Denver, is a must-visit for anyone who loves a great sandwich, strong drinks, and a vibrant atmosphere. Nestled in LoDo, this spot has made a name for itself with its creative take on French dips, but there\u2019s so much more to appreciate beyond the sandwiches. Whether you\u2019re stopping by for a casual bite, late-night drinks, or a weekend hangout, Pony Up delivers on all fronts.\n\nOne of the highlights of any meal here is the crispy potatoes. These perfectly fried, golden-brown bites are addictive, offering the ideal combination of crunch on the outside and fluffy softness on the inside. They\u2019re served with a rich, flavorful aioli that elevates them to the next level. They make for an excellent side to any sandwich or just a great snack to share over drinks.\n\nSpeaking of sandwiches, the BLTA (bacon, lettuce, tomato, and avocado) is an absolute standout. This isn\u2019t your average BLT\u2014it\u2019s crafted with thick-cut, crispy bacon, ripe avocado, fresh lettuce, and juicy tomatoes, all layered on perfectly toasted bread. The balance of textures and flavors is spot-on, making it one of the best versions of this classic sandwich you\u2019ll find in Denver. The bread holds up well without overpowering the ingredients, allowing the bacon and avocado to shine.\n\nOf course, Pony Up is best known for its French dips, and it\u2019s easy to see why. The menu boasts a variety of options, from traditional beef to creative spins featuring different proteins and flavors. The high-quality ingredients and attention to detail make each bite satisfying.\n\nBeyond the food, Pony Up has an inviting and energetic atmosphere. The bar program is impressive, featuring well-crafted cocktails, a solid beer selection, and a great lineup of spirits. The bartenders are skilled and friendly, making strong yet balanced drinks that pair well with the menu. Whether you\u2019re in the mood for a classic old fashioned or a creative house cocktail, you won\u2019t be disappointed.\n\nThe space itself is cozy yet lively, with a mix of bar seating, tables, and booths. The dim lighting and stylish decor create a warm and inviting ambiance that feels perfect for a night out. It\u2019s a great place to catch up with friends, enjoy a casual date, or even just grab a quick bite solo at the bar.\n\nPony Up also excels in providing a late-night dining experience that\u2019s hard to find in Denver. With many restaurants closing early, it\u2019s refreshing to have a spot that serves high-quality food well into the night.\n\nThe service is generally friendly and efficient, with staff who are knowledgeable about the menu and happy to make recommendations. While it can get busy, especially on weekends, the energy only adds to the experience.\n\nIf you\u2019re in Denver and looking for a place that combines great food, a solid drink selection, and a welcoming atmosphere, Pony Up should be at the top of your list. The crispy potatoes and BLTA alone make it worth the visit, but once you\u2019re there, you\u2019ll likely find yourself tempted by the rest of the menu. Whether you\u2019re a local or just passing through, this spot is a gem that\u2019s well worth your time. Probably my favorite restaurant and bar in all of Denver. Best french onion soup, great atmosphere, and attentive staff. We\u2019ve been on multiple occasions, including birthdays, and there is always a cozy space for our party. Just stopped for Drinks. Sat at the bar. Nice watering hole for sure. I kind of wish I was able to try some of the food. It looked good What a gem! Some of the best cocktails I've had at some of the best prices downtown Denver has to offer. Plus, service and atmosphere were both excellent. Across the street from the Milk Market, it's super easy to get to. Will 100% be back!"

    "reviews": "This is a really cool place. I had a great time. Known as a whiskey bar, but I didn\u2019t the whiskey.  Still this place has a great vibe.  We had the pleasure of getting Paulie who added so much to our experience.\n\nThe Duck wings were amazing with the Spicy Honey Garlic sauce.\n\nAlso a really cool sports bar feel.  Had an old Ali boxing match on, lots of cowboy fans.    I will be back Stopped in for a quick bite and beverage after our flight as we were tired and hungry! Sat at the bar and the bartender was in great spirits and very friendly. The food was surprisingly delicious for bar food and I enjoyed their IPA\u2019s on tap. Overall, I would stop by again if I\u2019m ever in the Denver area again! Secret Society is more like it!!!  Visiting from out of town and wanted something more local.  Found this GEM.  This place is way larger than it appears.  Was welcomed with a smile and great personality.  Our bartender Russell was NEXT LEVEL on service.  So besides that multitude of TV\u2019s and games on, there is a HUGE variety of beverages.  So what else besides also getting some yum yum.  Well WOW on portion size.  Food was great tasting and priced right on.  Have saved this as a must visit for anytime in Denver.  Thanks for the great memories. If you like a good down to earth sports bar, this is it! The bartenders are awesome, the food is good, and there\u2019s no frills. Perfect spot after a game at Ball arena. Added bonus, the locals who frequent the joint are also awesome & friendly. Guaranteed a good time! What a wonderful experience. Staff are great. Food is pretty darn good classic bar food. We came to watch hockey from out of town and able to enjoy and hang out."

    "reviews": "We stopped into Wynkoop Brewing after a day of exploring downtown Denver and really enjoyed the experience.\n\nThe atmosphere is relaxed with plenty of character (loved the gorilla statue by the brewery tanks!), and the beer was spot-on.\n\nOur server was friendly and helpful, and there was a great selection of brews on tap.\n\nA perfect place to take a break and soak up some local flavour. Would definitely return! Went for a late lunch on a Tuesday and we were treated like royalty \ud83d\ude09  Zack made sure we had good food to go along with great beers!  Pool is free 11a-4p (weekdays?) so we knocked some balls around.\n\nTables are well-spaced and the beer selection was great.  We grabbed a couple of IPAs (filtered) and hit the green!  Food came out fast and the menu is diverse enough to feed our special picky eater.\n\nI'd recommend they get some cues that are straight (1 out of the 20 we checked were hella bad, that 1 was tolerable at best), otherwise you may need to bring your own.  Balls are okay with a few missing a chip here and there.\n\nGet the beer cheese pretzel and the Sheppard's Pie, you won't be disappointed with eother.  Or both!!\n\nJust a couple blocks from Coors Stadium.  Watch for crowds from 4p onwards on game nights.\n\nHad a really nice time for a late lunch and hope to be back soon!  Thanks Zack! The burgers here are great especially the bison burger. The atomsphere is on point it was really cozy and fun. There were arcade games upstairs. The service was pretty fast and friendly. I tried the classic burger and their root beer. Burger was great I didn't really like the root beer but we easily swapped it out for another soda. Seriously try the bison burger I only had a bite of my sister's but it was great. Good beer. Nice atmosphere in a place near the baseball stadium and the train station. It\u2019s 1890\u2019s building. Really cool. I saw people hanging out in groups of friends, having dates and in a wedding ceremony. There are separe rooms inside the building. They also offer food and drinks. Great beers, good variety and some very original. Beer list changes often and all beers brewed in house. Bison burger was very flavorful, would get it again for sure. Fried pickle spears were battered and spiced very well. Upstairs they have literally 15 pool tables and another bar. Place is great."

    "reviews": "What a lovely experience at this location. The waiter was top-notch. Paid close attention to detail. He made our dining experience exceptional. My t c o burger was scrumptious. The atmosphere is fun yet relaxing. The decor draws you in. Recommend this location Had the best brunch experience this past weekend! The food was amazing and shout out to our waitress Sarah F! She gave such great recommendations and provided us with amazing hospitality After attending a show at the Ellie Caulkins Opera House, we decided to stop by The Corner Office for a cocktail and dessert. While the menu for both was somewhat limited, we didn\u2019t mind at all\u2014sometimes fewer options make for a more focused and enjoyable dining experience. The atmosphere was a perfect blend of classy and casual, with plenty of bar seating, tables, and cozy nooks that create an inviting and relaxed vibe. We ordered a couple of cocktails, \u201cThe Best Practice\u201d and \u201cClosing Arguments\u201d, both well-crafted cocktails. We also took advantage of the dessert menu and ordered the Waffle Sundae, and the Mousse (raspberry mousse inside a pink chocolate shell), both sizable and delicious. The service was friendly, attentive, and efficient, making our experience even more enjoyable. The convenience of being able to walk right across the street after an event was a huge plus. We\u2019re already looking forward to returning for a full meal to explore more of what their menu has to offer! A previous experience here was somewhat less than great but I always like giving a place a second chance.  This time the food and service were great.  My prime rib sandwich was loaded with tender meat and the bread was very fresh.  My wife said her short ribs were excellent and our granddaughter loved her salmon.  Service was very attentive and friendly.  Will definitely return in the future. Loved this place! Especially the Burrata dish-flavor explosion & Pimento cheese-amazingness! Wish I didn\u2019t live in another state or I\u2019d be back frequently.  Bartenders and servers rock & friendly!"

    "reviews": "This placed lived up to our expectations and then some. We love Wisconsin food and often travel for things like solidly good poutine - as you can often find cheese curds and pretzels on more menus but this place has it ALL. They also have a combined shared space, expanding the menu and beer options, and the overall vibe is fantastic. High energy and great service. The poutine was FIRE and I've been dreaming about it ever since. The curds were straight outta Wisconsin and are delicious. The pretzel was the least exciting thing but only because it was a bit sweet, like it was next to the sweet pretzel they offer but we'd get it again. The cheese fondue dip was amazing. Solid beer selection, something for everyone! Can't wait to go back. Wally's Wisconsin Tavern was a unique place. My family is from Wisconsin and I spend a lot of time there so it was cool to see a familiar place. The cheese curds were excellent and the beer selection was good. It's not often I can get Hams or Old Style I grew up near Sheboygan and know what a WI brat tastes like.  what they serve is not even close.  no classic brat spice.  sauerkraut was bland, too.\nservice was great and LOVED the Schlitz signs. We may have come on an off night or something, but the giant pretzel was very disappointing. It was over baked and tasted like it was sitting under the heat lamp for hours. We had to saw it with a knife and it was inedible.  We sent it back.\nDenver Brat was good, and the beer was cold.  Service was ok. Leaving WI for CA as we travel the country for work, we had a craving for some fresh water fish. Yup, we're originally from WI, and while driving thru Denver, we found this establishment on google! We were beyond excited!\nWe are also tournament fishermen & and self-proclaimed fish connisuers! \ud83d\udc1f\nUpon entering, We were a bit confused as the Wally's I'd connected to a German restaurant, so there's two different doors outside, but access to both inside. I'm not sure the German restaurant and Wallys did both because there are definitely a lot of Germans in WI as well as Irish. \ud83d\ude05\nSat down on Wally's bar side first. Wonderfully decorated as any back woods WI bar. Deer \ud83e\udd8c mounted on the wall n all. As any normal wisconite, I sat down prior to eating and asked if he (the bartender) made a good bloody Mary. He and his friend stayed at the bar, giggling, and said I mean, it's pretty easy.\"\n\" You can't mess it up! Wrong bar keep you certainly can I informed him.  The western United States \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 does every day! \ud83d\ude05\ud83e\udd2d and he most certainly lived up to my words.\nIt's a bit dark on that side & since we were driving across the country, we needed to stay awake, so we went to the connected bar, which was much bigger and well lit. The German style restaurant (forgive me as I can't remember the name) was extremely clean, as were the restrooms. Our bartender, who I unfortunately forgot to get his name, was amazing. No matter how many people were seated at this large bar area, He not only kept up but also provided great customer service skills to each and every customer.\nOf course, we ordered the walleye! My husband did the AUCE & while I ordered the reg meal. I'm not sure if the owner is from WI, but I'm guessing they are. While I lived in CO years ago, there seemed to be a lot of people from WI & even more Packer fans! Anyway, if the owner is from WI, they need a quick visit there to remind them of the traditional fish fry experience. \ud83e\udd2d\nWhen the fish arrived at our table, we immediately noticed the heavy breading and way overcooked. I mean, really overcooked! We tried a bit but it was just thick, dry & burnt breading. We couldn't do it. We talked to the bartender who also said he noticed, so he went to the kitchen requesting more fish, preferably not burnt. Not long after he brought out another plate of fish, and again burnt. He even said sorry this one is dark as well. He placed the plate down and returned to the kitchen for yet another plate of fish.\nThe 3rd plate was more appealing as to not being burnt, so we appreciated that but as soon as we each bit into our fish I about gagged. Both of our fish had the blood line still in tact. Nope, I can't do it.\nBetween the thick breading, I couldn't taste wallye even if it was decent, bones galore and the bloodline we couldn't do it. May want to check into a new distributor with new recipe, please. C'mon WI needs to represent \ud83d\udc4f \ud83d\ude4c we will take the owner fishing on Lake of Green Bay & Lake Erie and then make them real WI walleye and bloody marys!  They won't ever look back. \ud83e\udd2b\ud83e\udee3\ud83e\udd2d\nI will say that the coleslaw was phenomenal \ud83d\udc4f great job! I over did it on that since I couldn't eat the fish. Oh BTW what kind of malarkey is this toasted rye shenanigans \ud83d\ude1c \ud83e\udd14\nI tried figuring out where the toasted came from, I know the Danish do it. Germans may toast for breakfast sandwiches \ud83e\udd6a but nope, I never had toasted toasted rye with fresh water fish.\n*Fun fact- rye bread was originally served with fish (not toasted) as a way or place to keep bones.\nAgain, thanks to the amazing bar tender who did everything to make the experience great!"

    "reviews": "The chicken sandwich was good, the kids butter pasta was not bad as well. It\u2019s a great little American spot but nothing outstanding. They also have up to date sports playing and it\u2019s also in a nice area that you can walk near complexes and 16th street as well. 11/10. I had the Silo Burger with a splash of hot sauce on top. Incredible. Credit to Paul(FoH) and Victor(BoH) for my best burger experience Q1 2025.\n\nUpdate to the best HH wings I've had in Denver(new pic submitted) We went to the Denver location on market Street to see a comedy show. John Caparulo was incredible!! Before and after the show we had drinks and food with Chase. Chase was an awesome bartender. He went above and beyond on multiple levels. He is very attentive and he pays close attention to details! The beer was awesome! The drinks were great and we will definitely be back anytime we are in downtown Denver! This place is decent enough but they add some sort of made up \"living wage surcharge\" to the bill. It's not my job to pay the salary of the employees. They could just raise their prices if they wanted to generate more revenue for the employees. A friend recommended Oskar since they had a\u00a0good dining experience. As for me I must\u00a0have gone on an off night. Customer service  wasn't the best. Waitress stated it was her third day and was on her\u00a0phone most of the time and it was hard to get her\u00a0attention just to get more water. Also appetizers\u00a0usually\u00a0come out before your\u00a0meal but ours came out with the meal. We ordered the catfish bites and had the burgers which were ok. I will come back again and hopefully I have a better experience.\u00a0 The atmosphere and music was good I must say."

    "reviews": "We arrived at Nallen's Irish Pub, on a Wednesday evening, and it quickly became clear that this is one of the best-kept secrets in downtown Denver. Out of all the bars we\u2019ve visited in the area, Nallen's stands out as the most authentic, laid-back spot, free from the overly flashy vibe you find at many other downtown establishments.\n\nThe atmosphere here is unbeatable. With a classic bar to belly up to, multiple TVs, a large projector, and even a jukebox, this place oozes character and charm. The relaxed 70\u2019s music playing softly in the background adds a nostalgic touch, making it feel like a scene straight out of a movie. Whether you\u2019re stopping in for a quick drink or looking for a spot to settle in for the evening, Nallen's is the perfect setting to unwind.\n\nSean, our bartender, elevated the experience even further. He was attentive, friendly, and incredibly quick with our drinks. His great attitude made us feel welcomed and added to the overall vibe of the place. The drink specials were the icing on the cake\u2014amazingly priced and offering great value compared to other downtown options.\n\nNallen\u2019s is the kind of pub that makes you want to seek out Irish bars wherever you go because it captures that unique, comforting, and no-frills energy. If you\u2019re in Denver and looking for a place to escape the hustle and bustle of the city while enjoying great drinks in a fantastic atmosphere, this is the spot. It\u2019s safe to say Nallen\u2019s Irish Pub is now our go-to bar in Denver! Fine Irish Pub in bustling area of Denver. Limited seating but there's a outdoor patio in the back. Plenty of drink options at the bar. Cash preferred. Killer pub with great Guinness! The bar lady was super kind. Great atmosphere as well. Come see them soon! Came here for the Guinness and it did not disappoint. If you\u2019re a Guinness lover then definitely give it a shot. They pour it the right way, it has a super clean taste and a descent schtick. Loved the atmosphere and the set up. Had a good conversation with Bill and one of the regulars. I came just for a few pints and stayed for a few more. Great spot, highly recommend if you want to grab a drink off Larimer but don't want to deal with snobby people or silly 20 somethings. Strong drinks and a chill vibe, I look forward to returning!"

    "reviews": "A nice joint on the edge of downtown that was a nice little escape from the stuffier spots that are closer to downtown. The service was great and it seemed as though the establishment itself was living through the stories we heard and the decor we saw while we were hanging out. I'd love to be there in St. Paddy's day for sure. It was only a short scooter ride away from our hotel in downtown and worth the journey. Regular here but experienced very bad energy from the security up front named Virgil that easedropped on a conversation about my friend and I running into someone I used to have a crush on inside. As people of color, he stopped us from coming and and said \"I heard what you said and don't want you coming in if you are going to fight any of our customers.\" I told him that is false but he kept cutting me off stating he heard what my friend and I were talking about. He made me feel extremely uncomfortable and uneasy that I decided to just go home. I left 5 stars in the last for this location. Please do better with the staff that you hire that have a bias against people of color. Friendly staff, reasonable prices, good pours, but the music situation makes it undesirable to be there for more than 15 minutes. Friday night the place was completely empty because they don\u2019t know to play half decent music, unfortunate. Great karaoke bar. The sound volume was just a bit too high but, rather than that, everything was fine. Great staff! How can describe this joint other than friggin Awesome! My kind of folks! I went there for a drink with a friend on Marine Corps b-day and it ended up being one of the best nights Ive had in a while. All the staff are super nice and cool, the Vets were just absolutely amazing! We sang we drank\u2026We had a blast! Thx for the memories yall! Semper Fi!"

    "reviews": "Stopped by after a Rockies game for some food and beer. Open seating, but our server found us quickly and got our orders going. I got the ballpark burger and my husband had nachos with chicken. Both were pretty mid. I wish I had added cheese to the burger. Nachos were a huge portion, you could easily share with a group. Vibes were good though. After leaving a concert down the street, walking to our car we saw they were playing the fights that night and decided to stop by. It was late and the main event was about to be on but they were still seating and serving people as normal. We got a booth right away with a TV and ordered the buffalo wings. The food came out quickly, our server was great keeping our waters full. We really enjoyed watching the fights. But the wings were not great, the sauce had an odd flavor and texture. Wouldn\u2019t order the wings again but would come to watch the fights again. Do keep in mind this location is like a night club, so lots of noise and music blasting. A truly awful experience from start to finish. The place has a neglected, uninviting atmosphere \u2014 you can sense the lack of care the moment you walk in. The food is subpar: bland, poorly presented, and clearly made with low-quality ingredients. The beer selection is equally disappointing \u2014 limited options, bad taste, and outrageously overpriced for what\u2019s offered.\n\nBut the worst part by far is the service, which borders on nonexistent. The waiter didn\u2019t bother to bring a menu, offered no information about what was available or out of stock, and showed zero interest in providing even basic hospitality. He brought a bottle of beer to the table without even a glass \u2014 a small gesture that perfectly sums up the overall carelessness.\n\nIn a city like Denver, known for its vibrant food and drink scene, this place stands out as a low point. Absolutely not recommended \u2014 there are far better places to spend your evening. Really great food! Loved the buffalo cauliflower. For vegetarians, any burger can be made with a beyond patty. Definitely enjoy the outdoor seating if warm. I love this venue because of the good eats and convenient location. The saff is also super nice and helpful. The staff who helped us with the VMC event...I cannot thank you enough. Superb and so helpful!"

    "reviews": "Lively sports bar focused on English Premiere League football but also local Denver teams. Many great beers on tap and a solid food menu make it a good hangout. Proper English pub. Service (especially Kevin) is spot on. Recently my place to go especially with lunches with colleagues. Food is well prepared and served quickly. Haven\u2019t had a bad meal yet and I\u2019ve decided to try everything one meal at a time. Atmosphere is spot on, fun place for music, friends, and football (the real kind played with feet not some boring pointed ball). What makes this place really shine is the staff. I\u2019ve only been here daytime but everyone has been the best. Very attentive and kind to all. Really cool spot. Decent beer selection and great food. I'd recommend the shepherd's pie and the bangers and mash. The sausage is made in house and is very tasty, but I have to caution against the scotch egg as it is unfortunately hard boiled and doesn't give a good scotch egg impression even if the sausage they use for it is incredible. I understand that it can be difficult to make a nice runny scotch egg so I don't blame them for this but I do wish it had that nice runny yolk.  I can say for sure the bangers and mash as well as the shepherd's pie was fantastic, and someone got some fries near me and they smelled delicious but I haven't tried them yet. The bangers were very tasty and super juicy too, so I would personally recommend trying those first.\n\nThe staff has been incredible as well, Brittanie was great and the other guy (can't remember his name sorry!) who served me a couple weeks ago was also a great bartender.\n\nI really like the atmosphere in here as well, seems like a really cozy spot. I can't verify the authenticity of the British pub vibe but they seem to do a good job, coming from an American. Touchtunes jukebox so either set your own music or vibe to whatever someone else is playing/random mix. Best Brittish pub in Denver and serves the best \"English Breakfast\" as far as I know!\n\nThanks for the good food! DJ Bella~B\n@dj.bellab.ig on Facebook & IG This is a phenomenal soccer pub.\nWe were there during El Classico and had an absolute blast! Decently priced drinks. Bangers and Mash was solid. It is a smaller bar, but that just adds to the atmosphere."

    "reviews": "Aubree was absolutely fantastic! One of the kindest and most attentive bartenders I've ever had. She is amazing and I will definitely keep coming back because of her! I understand why certain rules have to be made, believe me I do. My job is literally making sure the rules are being followed but when you guys have rules about neck tattoos please make exceptions when they ARE NOT GANG RELATED. Also, make sure your staff are agreement with those rules. Letting us in one week and the next not ??  How did we get in for a whole year with no issue the last time literally being a week ago. My friend was a girl with a flower neck tattoo but just this friday we got denied. Seriously what tf are yall doing. I went in on a Saturday night with my girls and the vibe was so good! All the bartenders are great but Aubree really made the vibes that much better. She was so sweet and made the night so fun! Definitely will be returning for Aubree! Seriously needs training on hospitality. Not everything need to be a wwe match. I was simply trying to use  the men bathrooms like a men should and a female was in there    When a security walked in told her to stop and as she was doing and she said no. I said nothing waiting patiently got the man to finish I was wrongly drug out because the security thought I said something when I was just quietly waiting for a stall that\u2019s one person was doing drugs at and the other was a female. I walked in at the wrong time.  All I said was. I  was wrongly accused of throwing a first punch was untrue I was to intoxicated to even think of fighting let alone pee. Then I was drug down the stairs like a criminal when I was criminally and confused what was happening. Absolutely amazing hospitality from the front door security with Dante, Travis, and Matt always taking their precautions. To all the bar staff Rayna, Logan, Kat and many more thank you for always creating the best atmosphere in the Denver area."

    "reviews": "This is a great lodge haus feel while providing the sports and energy you want. Interior is designed like you would expect to see in Germany on the slopes- fireplace and all. The food is made and fresh. Fast service, super friendly staff, plenty of seating on either level. But not crowded and no bumping into each table. Such a cool place. Worth a visit just to see it! Love this place! I've been coming here for a few years now whenever I can before a game. Great beer, great pretzels, and everything else I've had has been fantastic. We most recently had the smorgasbord, and no joke, the sausage and mashed potatoes that came with it were the best I'd ever had. Everything else on the smorgasbord was great too, it's just that the sausage and mashed potatoes were out of this world and deserved their own shout-out.\nThe staff is always great too. They're always welcoming, checking on us, and are very knowledgeable about the menu items. We were positively surprised with their sausages selection. This is definitely the best German food in Denver! Our waiter was very attentive and brought our orders quickly even though the place was packed on a Saturday evening. We will be back! Rheim Haus was awesome. The giant German beers and large portions were delicious. I was worried the giant pretzel would be tuff or some sort of frozen thawed cooked pretzel but it wasn't. It was delicious and fresh. The food plates were also giant. The food here is great but the table service can be lacking it seems because it took quite a while to get drinks and the check and never got refills for any drinks. But once again, the food is great so I would go again just for that or maybe even just order takeout. PARKING SUCKS on the weekends because the minimum payment is not worth it to eat there. Also the restaurant is super loud a lot of the time where you can't hear yourself think."

    "reviews": "Oysters were amazing, cocktails are prepared table-side, service was delayed a bit which was nice since I mentioned I was on a first date. Definitely a charming and quiet date night spot, so long as you avoid the busy dinner rush! Will be coming back to try the lounge menu :) Very swanky steakhouse. The food was delicious and the staff was great. The complimentary bread before the meal is incredible. I also had the French onion soup, wedge salad, potatoes Au Gratin, and the New York Strip with B\u00e9arnaise sauce. Everything was great and I was stuffed by the end of the meal. Great place if you want a fancy dinner to celebrate a special occasion or celebration. Sushi was amazing! Calamari was amazing! Scallops were perfect lobster was honestly a little underwhelming. Wife\u2019s fish was great! Service was top notch. Celebrating my whole families birthdays. I always wondered if leaving a not on what the occasion was did something and the entire visit they celebrated with us! The ending cheese cake and chocolate cake were amazing as well. Great night out! To preface my review, I had just flown into Denver and the meals I had for the next multiple days were similarly underwhelming for me, so there is a chance my taste buds had not acclimated to the altitude. However, I do feel like enough was off on this pricey meal to think that altitude adjustment was not the only issue.\n\nService was good, my flight was delayed so we did have to rush a bit, but the waiter was on top of it and got us out just fine.\n\nThe bread was good, and my drink was fun. Honestly, it was a bit hard to drink, as the fizz lasted for like 30 minutes, and I had no desire to get berry stains everywhere, but it was tasty.\n\nThe flavor of the appetizer of scallops and braised beef was pretty good, though the scallop was a little overcooked (slightly too chewy). My dad didn\u2019t love that the same red wine sauce came on the scallop as the beef, but that\u2019s his preference, I didn\u2019t mind too much. It was also very small, so having the scallop less than perfect was a bit of a bummer.\n\nThe steak was the most disappointing part, for me, because it came out overcooked. I didn\u2019t have time to send it back, though, so I ate it and didn\u2019t make a big deal out of it. The Brussels sprouts were also very plain. I love Brussels, but I wouldn\u2019t order those again.\n\nThe butter cake was fine, not *quite* as good as I remember, but still enjoyable, so I\u2019m willing to blame that on altitude adjustment.\n\nOne of our favorite meals of all time was at Ocean Prime in Boston, to the point where we changed our trip to go back a second time within the week. So this was quite disappointing. The hostess was very friendly and made me feel at home. My waitress was also very friendly and attentive. I ordered the 16oz Ribeye and added a lobster tail and mushrooms. The steak was cooked to perfection, had great flavor, and just the right blend of fat and meat. The lobster was also cooked perfectly and tasted so good. The mushrooms were delicious. It was all delicious. The atmosphere was romantic but alive with conversation. My only complaint would be that the lobster tail could have been a little bigger for the price. Other than that, I really enjoyed my dinner."

    "reviews": "We had an amazing time at dazzle! Unfortunately, we went there for Father\u2019s Day and didn\u2019t really like the act that performed, but who we did see this time around was amazing so happy that we get to check out a jazz spot that\u2019s just right around the corner and off 16th St.the food was pretty good too highly recommend eating anything. Gratuity $18 ontopof of $120 was a bit out of my league for two $28 plates that was their special fire Salmon plate that evening, plus the two drinks with added pineapple, and extra garlic bread as an added bread. Moving forward..The C2 MASS CHOIR and all their guest artists  were great! I know now what not to do if I attend the Dazzle venue again\ud83c\udf39\ud83d\ude4f Big shot out to their cook (s). Such a fan of Dazzle. The music, the energy, the drinks, and food! So much talent and heart in the space! The artists are always so good. Their spiked hot cider always gets me in the right place.\n\nI have been a few times and have only enjoyed drinks. The last time I went I got the Salvadoran tamale and it was AMAZING! Highly recommend. The staff is always friendly and the bartender is a pro. Super intimate little jazz club with reasonable prices, especially for Denver. The band, Dear Luna, was incredible, and the seating was a lot better than it appears on the website. Honestly, I was pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed myself! Went here with my family of 4. We saw an Aretha Franklin tribute band that was incredible! There weren't many options to sit all 4 together. Most seating options are two per small table but groups could sit adjacent and communicate fine. The drinks were very well made and we greatly enjoyed the live music! I recommend ordering food and drinks via the QR code on the table and the following website. It will make the ordering and delivery way more efficient during the lights off parts of the show."

    "reviews": "I got the cubano and it was terrific. Tried the brewery IPA, pretty good as well.  Service was fast and friendly, you should check it out if you are in the area if you need a quick bite and a beer! This restaurant is loosely affiliated with the SpringHill Suites but is across the courtyard from the hotel in the Metropolitan State University of Denver building. The school provides beer from its Brewing School to the restaurant.\n\nIt is open M-F but closed on the weekends.\n\nThe food is good, but the selection is limited to burgers and salads and a few appetizers. It's good, but not great, and part of the issue is the real lack of presentation and finish. We had the Mahalo salad with salmon; it would have been great, but the salmon was dry and overcooked and served skin side up on the salad. Just no reason to serve an overcooked piece of salmon. It actually looked as if it was pre-cooked and sat around waiting for the order.\n\nHad the Backroad Burger on one night. Was tasty, but again, seemed thrown together and was unbelievably messy to eat. The tater tots on the side were just tater tots served with a just-so-so dipping sauce.\n\nOne of the two nights we ate there was just an average slow night; it was snowing and the walk across the courtyard a chilly one. The place seemed to have adequate staff, but they didn't seem all that excited about serving anyone. No one really checked back to see if we needed a second drink or if things were okay; getting a check took extra effort, and when we got it, there was an error that took a team conversation to resolve.\n\nThe second night was just before a game at the very nearby Ball Arena, and the place was packed. Staff was more available, but frankly not that much more interested in the guests. All in all, I'll say it again: the food was good, not outstanding, and the issue is more the small things and the service that hold it back.\n\nAs a footnote, the actual menu when we were there is less broad than the one-line menu suggests.\n\nThere is no free parking there, and the valet is $25. Not surprising given the proximity to a major sports facility. -Note- I made this review a year ago and since then there has been a change in management and the restaurant has changed its menu to not include the incredible items that I have pictured here. The new menu seems to be more health focused, but is not as zesty and creative. To be brutally honest for example, their new tomato jam is strange on a chicken sandwich and many of the items that were switched up were some of the best such as the fried pickles. The atmosphere is always sleek, clean and inviting though. I am a student at CU Denver and I know I can come sit down here in a relaxing vibe and produce on my computer. Tate was so amazing! Very attentive and on top of things. Food was sooo good! Creme brulee cheesecake was amazing! Will be coming back, thank you!!! We were looking to eat something before going to the Pepsi Center for a concert. This place won because of proximity. We were pleasantly surprised when the food tasted great, we received great service and it didn\u2019t break the bank! Definitely a place we\u2019d hit again the next time we have an event nearby. The Cuban sandwich was yummy (photo) as were the dishes enjoyed by the others in the group (Bahn you, BLT)."

    "reviews": "Amazing service! Make sure to tip these guys well if you get a chance. They all do their job with a smile on their face. Food was GREAT! Would definitely come back for hibiscus margaritas on ice and TACOS! I spent $40 on 3 drinks (2 shots 1 marg) and esquites. WORST esquites I\u2019ve ever had: they soaked the corn in water like a soup, and because of that, the spices diluted immediately. I\u2019m only rating 2 stars because the service was great and the atmosphere was cool. Good food! Came with some friends and order the party size tacos. They are not truly street tacos but still great tacos. One down thing is they do not offer spicy salsa for the tacos. We asked for the spicy salsa and it was not hot at all. But overall highly recommend!! I get why this place has 4ish stars. The food is good, it's not great, it doesn't wow you at all but it is solid. Great atmosphere though a little dead for a Thursday night. The server was very honest with menu suggestions which we really appreciated and was very attentive We were going to take the train from Union Station so we decided to eat here since it is so close to the station.  I was not expecting much, thinking it was just a cheap taco place.  But it was REALLY good.  I don't get enthusiastic about restaurants all that much but this place was different.  Our server was friendly and quite attentive.  She also knew the details of the menu down cold.  I ordered the shrimp quesadilla and it was spectacular - really good.  Everyone else in our group said the same about their dinner.   The only downside was the price - $210 with tip for a group of 4 with one drink each, and no dessert.  Not unbelievable, but not cheap.  Even so, it was a great experience.  I'll be back."

I really wanted to try the pizza but was informed that they were out of dough which was disappointing. I had the sirloin steak which was good, with mashed potatoes and green beans which were both excellent. The light lager was really nice as well. We had a good time and would recommend this place! Hopefully the dough won't be an issue and we can try out that pizza! I ordered fish and chips. It was average, nothing to brag about. Athmosphere is good, sitting outside with a band playing. Service was below aberage, the place was bareky empty, food came before utensils and napkins. I had to ask for it, ketchup I had to ask twice. Waiter never bothere to ask if you needed anything else. If the waiter reads this, thats the reason the tip is low, I usually give 25% or higher tip, even when food is bad unless the waiter is the problem. The $2.00 tip reflects the service. First spot I ate at in Denver for a work trip and I ate here twice more in the same week. Beers, pizza and wings were all spectacular. They were busy and service was slow but they apologized. Food was delicious and I enjoyed my Red Rocks and the steak salad. Beer is good. Service is fast. Food (fish and chips) was tasty and a pretty good size for the price."

And Shay is pretty awesome, too!\n\nWe stopped in here on a Friday afternoon before a Rockies game in July 2024 for a quick bite to eat and a few drinks. Drinks were great and the food was good too.\n\nThe staff was super friendly and treated us like old friends. They were kind enough to offer up some great recommendations for the Denver area as well, which we appreciated as we were visiting from Florida.\n\nIf you're looking for a casual, laid back atmosphere to grab a drink or two, you definitely need to stop in here! The beer is cheap, and the service is good, but it's a well-worn neighborhood place, not necessarily a \"where to take mom when she's in town\" place, unless your mom likes bar trivia. Giggly Grizzly\u2019s is AWESOME!!!!! From the moment we walked in, we were greeted with enthusiasm and helped immediately. Though it was a busy pre-game environment, we were treated with intimacy and friendliness! Great selection, great prices. The late kitchen is perfect to snag a bite to eat before you head home from a Rockies Game! I lost my wallet nearby and the manager, Wendi, reached out to find me.  I never actually went to the bar aside from picking up my wallet but they clearly have a staff that goes the extra mile! Music WAY too loud. Can't talk or hear anything. Have to shout and kill my voice. Music is low class and shut. Drinks were some concoction I didn't trust at all. Would definitely never go here again or recommend to anyone. Design and cleanness is ok."

And you can order food from the adjacent Milk Market to your table.\n\nI didn\u2019t catch her name. But the lady behind the bar was awesome. So friendly and fun, and knowledgeable about the beers. And she makes this bar a must visit place for me whenever I travel through Denver. A nice little brewery in a cute alley in Downtown Denver. They have some different craft beers, hard tea and ciders. It's on a great location because you can get food from the milk market as well. Great vibes Easy drinking beer - not terribly diverse menu, but well crafted if into an ipa or lager. Beer aside the ambience cannot be beat! The interior is just as posh and inviting as the exterior is cute and clean. Perfect spot for a drink, date, or whatever! Dog friendly to the max \ud83d\udc3e \u2764\ufe0f Walking by, saw a nice alleyway that was decorated. Saw the brewery and had 2 pints. SUPERB beer.

I went for my birthday and it was an unforgettable experience. My server Lana was the absolute best!!! Both herself and the kitchen staff took such great care of me and made me feel very celebrated and special. I\u2019m so glad I chose Guard and Grace to celebrate and I\u2019ll never forget my experience there. Lana, thank you so much for such a fabulous evening. \u2764\ufe0f You made my day. This place is amazing. Best service and staff I've ever experienced. Derrick, our server, was attentive and patient with all of our questions. Carlos, the server assistant, was wonderful and friendly. The lady manager(with the henna) stopped by too and was very sweet. We ordered a little bit of everything to try more menu items. Oysters were very fresh and tasty. Brussels sprouts, burrata, spin dip, mac n cheese, toffee cake, cocktails, and the mini banana oldies at the end were all excellent. Everything was full of flavor and delicious. Can't wait to go back and try more. Thank you so much for a lovely lunch We celebrated our anniversary here about a week ago, and I haven\u2019t been able to stop thinking about it since!\nA huge thank you to our server, Alex, for making it such a special night. Not only was he incredibly knowledgeable about the menu, but his food and drink pairings were spot on. He even selected the perfect wine to pair with our steak, which elevated the whole experience. We were shocked to find out it was his first night on the floor\u2014he handled everything like a pro! I\u2019ve worked in the industry for over 13 years, so I can be picky, but I know a great hire when I see one.\nWe kicked things off with perfectly shaken martinis and one of the best\u2014if not the best\u2014crispy tunas I\u2019ve ever had. For dinner, we went with the filet flight (the chef will pre-slice it if you\u2019re sharing\u2014love that), and every cut was cooked to perfection. Our sides were the truffle mac (obviously) and the potatoes\u2014both delicious.\nAnd dessert? You have to get the banana tiramisu.\nThank you to the Guard and Grace team for an unforgettable evening! We could not have picked a better restaurant to enjoy our wedding dinner at! Nearly every staff member congratulated us personally and showered us with compliments making our day/dinner all the more special. Additionally, the amazing staff signed a congratulatory card and blessed us with a delicious dessert on the house! Other diners donated wine and offered many congratulations as well!\n\nWe truly loved how well the menu and different dishes were explained. To say the food and drinks were phenomenal would be an understatement--the quality, flavor, and presentation were unmatched and original! The kindness and genuine positivity of the staff was truly infectious! The timing in which each dish was delivered was spaced perfectly.\n\nOur experience was 20/10!!!! I cannot recommend Guard and Grace highly enough! Such a lovely experience. I really enjoyed our server who was absolutely amazing and walked us through each course. Complete perfection and excellence. This place is a must. Don\u2019t hesitate make your reservations today."

Connor was absolutely amazing, gave great recommendations and had such a great personality and pleasant conversations. Such a cute place, atmosphere is great. I absolutely recommend this place to anyone!! A Fantastic Dining Experience at Chop House and Brewery\n\nIf you're looking for a top-notch dining experience that balances quality food with great in-house brews, Chop House and Brewery is a must-visit.\n\nI started with the Seared Sashimi Tuna, which was grilled to perfection\u2014tender, flavorful, and complemented by a fantastic salad that added the right amount of freshness to the dish. For the main course, I had the 12 oz Prime Rib, ordered medium-rare, and it was cooked exactly as it should be\u2014juicy, tender, and packed with rich flavor. The white cheddar mashed potatoes were an excellent side, creamy and perfectly seasoned, adding an indulgent touch to the meal.\n\nTo top it off, the brewery had three house beers that I thoroughly enjoyed, each offering a distinct and well-crafted profile that paired beautifully with the food.\n\nOverall, Chop House and Brewery delivers on all fronts\u2014flavor, execution, and atmosphere. Highly recommend! Just stopped by for a quick drink and check it out for future visits and was not disappointed. Really nice classic pub ambiance with a long bar and views of their brewery vats. Service was excellent and I wish I could have stayed longer but unfortunately no time on this visit. The cream ale was delicious but next time I\u2019ll try a better mix . Very good food. Nice time. Very chill cool table. A nice way to end the week. The risotto bites were amazing. Steak was well cooked.\nReasonable price.\nService was nice, they gave us a dessert for our anniversary.\nGreat experience overall."

The employee made it seem like a good choice. So we came back together a couple hours later. I had the Debris Po Boy. Very delicious. My wife had the chicken tenders. Pretty good. We shared an amazing piece of key lime pie. We also had a good, but not great, piece of corn bread. Fantastic atmosphere. Would definitely go back if we are in Denver again Nola Jane\u2019s is a unique and refreshing spot in Denver for those lovers of the Big Easy. I enjoyed my time here. I can\u2019t give it 5 stars because there was very little attentive service, food was good, but overall just not a 5. Went to lunch here today and the food was so delicious! I had the fried okra and jalape\u00f1o hushpuppies for appetizers and the fried catfish plate with ettoufe\u00e9. The soft shell crab poboy was so good too! Don't miss out on this spot if your un downtown Denver! The food, THE FOOD!!! I am beyond impressed that food was not only hot and freshly made, but the cajun seasonings and spices were on point. The service was not the best, which is surprising because we were there during lunch on a week day. The cocktails were ok, but I'd come back again and again for the food. \ud83e\udd24 The food is soooooooo good, combined with the atmosphere and Chris made this place was AMAZING. will definitely be back here before we had back east. We had the Catfish Platter, Eggplant Creole plate, and BBQ Shrimp Mac n cheese. We highly recommend asking Chris or the staff for their input....they did not disappoint!"

Angie the weekday manager is an ANGEL, she is so kind and sweet and helpful. The food is always good and fresh, even if you go in at night. The taco salad shells are so light, crispy and fluffy, they are never stale, they are the best I've ever had! The staff always hooks me up with little perks and freebies, sometimes a little pack of extra chips, a side of salsa or the new picante ranch to try, or sometimes a cup for drinks,they really take excellent care of their customers. Everyone should try this Qdoba, you'll be so impressed, you'll never set foot in a Chipotle again. Thank you Angie and crew for always taking great care of me!!! Recently tried this location because it was near MSU. No pinto beans, no sour cream, they don\u2019t do promotions thru the app. They skimp on protein servings, and charge extra for cheese?? I\u2019m a broke hungry college student, they put profits before their customers. Completely unsatisfied from my food because it\u2019s just vegetables. Don\u2019t know if cost control to give you 70% of a soup but paid in 100%?! Tasted good yummmm! I walked from my hotel to grab a quick bite and honestly this might be the best Qdoba I\u2019ve ever eaten at. Super friendly and big portions. This spot > chipotle. We love Qdoba so much! Look at the size of my bowl. We walked in and were greeted by the workers who actually looked happy to be there and that they liked each other. Made my bowl and the worker was not messing around with the size of it and the portions. Best part is the free guacamole and queso. Check it out for an easy lunch! Delish and convienient."

    "reviews": "had a great time at the restaurant. Matt the bartender was an all-time best\u2014courteous, friendly, genuine, and super fun. The quality of the chicken tenders was out of control. It\u2019s a great place to enjoy a quick meal and a great atmosphere before a game. I\u2019d absolutely go back, not only for the food but especially for the incredible service\u2026even for us Yankee fans! Tony T's is the best spot to get a meal before a Rockies game or just to watch a big game on TV. The best chicken tenders in all of Denver and the service was great. I love that they support great local breweries and distilleries. They make amazing cocktails with some of the local distilleries spirits too. All of the staff were super nice and fun. 10/10 can't wait to go back again. Came here to watch playoff football and left with an amazing experience and a full stomach!\n\nThe chicken tenders were super juicy and fresh, the only downside and the only reason why I rated 4 stars and not 5 is because the sauce. They advertise their house made dipping sauces and I was let down. I tried 3 different sauces and none of them packed enough flavor and that was surprising because the chicken had a ton of flavor! If the sauces were better this would be a 10/10 restraunt but sadly it gets knocked down because of it.\n\nThe bartenders were also amazing and brought a ton of fun energy! Tony\u2019s is hands-down the best sports bar I\u2019ve ever been to! The atmosphere is electric, with TVs everywhere so you never miss a second of the game. The staff is incredibly friendly and attentive, making sure your drink is never empty.\n\nBut let\u2019s talk about the food\u2014those chicken tenders are next-level! Perfectly crispy on the outside, juicy on the inside, and paired with a variety of dipping sauces that take them over the top. Honestly, I\u2019d come back just for those tenders alone!\n\nWhether you\u2019re here for the game, a casual night out, or just some amazing food, Tony\u2019s is the place to be. Highly recommend to anyone looking for great vibes and even better eats. Bravo, Tony\u2019s! We hosted a Nuggets Playoff Viewing Party at Tony Tenderonis off Market street in Denver and it couldn't have gone better. The staff were very helpful in the execution and did a great job of setting the bar up. The food was fantastic, fresh and quickly delivered to guests. The TV and acoustic set up was perfect for a packed bar trying to watch an event. Everything went great and we can't wait to be back again in the future!"

Love their sangria and wine selection. And if you\u2019ve never tried Basque cheesecake, give it a try and it will be your latest obsession. We reserved a table with a big group of 10 and really enjoyed the variety and our tempered order size for such a large group. They were all honestly delicious, but the highlights were the bacon-wrapped dates filled with cream cheese (4 pieces), patatas bravas with octopus, moorish spiced ribs, and churros. Excellent sharing sizes and surprisingly well executed dishes for a high traffic tourist location in downtown. 100% will take my wife here on a date! We had a great experience! The tasting menu is worth the price. You get plenty of food. The bacon-wrapped dates were better than I expected. I don't really eat dates, but when I asked for a suggestion, that was one of them. They were very flavorful and worth the try. I didn't get a picture of those or the birthday dessert for my friend.\n\nThe bread was freshly made and delicious and the shrimp were also really good, the shrimp had a slight kick of spice to it. Ultreia is a great spot, when it comes to shareable plates, hanging around with some friends before or after the Rockies game or any other occasion, we find this place wonderful to be! Food is great and the service is fantastic!"

    "reviews": "Food and vibes were a 10/10. Highly recommend. Everything tasted great but my favorite was the crispy shredded pork with this super flavorful rice. Absolutely to die for. And the desserts?! Must must must. The empanadas were good but we took the extras home and had them the next day and they tasted even better. Service was fine but nothing great. Everyone was nice but it took us some time to get the waitress attention/ she wasn\u2019t around a ton. Though to her credit she was a tad bit busy. Overall great experience and I shall be returning! We stopped in just as they were opening, and it was fantastic - lovely patio, attentive service, and fantastic food. One of the folks in our party had some substantial food allergies, and the server was knowledgeable about the menu/prep and happy to help.\n\nEverything was delicious, and it was a lovely atmosphere to enjoy a spring evening. Cute space and delicious menu! Took me a long time to decide what to order that I have to come back! One Restroom is upstairs, but there's only one so you will have to go downstairs for more.  Restaurant pic looks empty as we gkt there right when they opened. By the time we left, the place was full! We had an 8:00 PM reservation and arrived early around 7:40. We placed our orders \u2014 drinks, appetizers, and entr\u00e9es \u2014 by 8:00. Unfortunately, by 9:00 PM, our food still hadn\u2019t arrived, and I had to speak with the manager. We later learned that it was our server\u2019s second day, which may have contributed to the delays.\n\nWhen the food did arrive, my daughter\u2019s steak, ordered rare, came out more than well-done \u2014 definitely disappointing. My husband and I both had the catch of the day, which was honestly very basic and lacked flavor.\n\nThe ambiance was nice, but the experience and food just didn\u2019t meet our expectations. 10/10 staff was great, friendly and attentive. Food was incredible. We all got different dishes and shared a little. I highly recommend this place to anyone wanting some delicious Cuban cuisine."

    "reviews": "So after class my classmates had happy hour at Colorado Campfire.. My first time at the venue and I may come back maybe. Why the maybe ? It\u2019s a cute space in \u201cUptown\u201d a part of\nDowntown Denver. It\u2019s definitely a place to watch sports: basketball and football, big screen TVs.\n\nBut the food wasn\u2019t that good but it wasn\u2019t that bad, possibly because I ordered a simple turkey BLT and fries. The fries weren\u2019t the greatest - seems as if I got the bottom of the basket. My coke was great, strong kick and great for my sandwich!\n\nSo the service was on point, quick, fast and easy ! And that\u2019s what matters, how they made me feel and the service! So I might just go back and try something else. \ud83e\uddd0\ud83e\udd28\ud83e\udd14 Great mile high BBQ! Everything from the good ol 303! Place was packed on the Friday we went. Very decent size place with a sports bar feel, food is outstanding, great beer selection. Killer place for Sunday football and even for those that don\u2019t like football, this bbq will keep you coming back. We visited for the first time last night. I ordered the campfire burger, and my wife ordered the pimento grilled cheese with tomato bisque. We had an appetizer of the pompano hush puppies and the honey sauce. For dessert, we ordered the blueberry cobbler.\nThe atmosphere was awesome. There are TVs with sports on each one in a fun bar area,  and regular restaurant seating for those wanting it. The lights were low, but not too low, and the seating was comfortable.\nOur server was helpful and outstanding. He told us some of the history of the restaurant (2019 onward) and provided great advice on the food.\nThe food was great. I was in the mood for a simple burger and fries, and it was perfect. The fries are seasoned special and really popped. The grilled cheese my wife ordered was simple but as billed. The tomato bisque was rich, thick, and well seasoned. Honestly, the bisque was the best dish of our collective order. The blueberry cobbler was a good dessert but could have used more crumble on top. It was 99% blueberry filling with only a few crumbles/breading on top. The shocking and pleasant surprise was just how damn good those poblano hush puppies were. With the honey sauce, they were outstanding. Don't miss out on ordering them.\nOur visit was delightful and special. Anyone in the downtown area in the mood for a good comfortable  experience should swing by Colorado Campfire. We came here for the tots! They were fantastic...loaded in all the best ways. We also shared the fried pretzel bites and a burger.\nThe burger and tots were so tasty. \ud83d\udc4c\n\nTotal honesty...would probably do the cinnamon sugar fried dough instead next time....as the bites were not very pretzel like.\n\nThe service was interesting. When we walked up....a brunette girl with a nose ring standing near the door walked away.... We were seated in her section.... Xander seated us and took our order, then someone else from the kitchen ran our food. After the girl in the burgundy bell bottom pants, same one that walked away from us when we walked up, dropped the iced tea at the table she stopped by once again to bring the check. We definately felt ignored....and noticed the obvious difference in her attention to other tables that came in and the service they received.\nThe food was delicious....the experience left a lot to be desired. Still all the stars for the food. Don't know that we would drive across town to be treated that way again. Went during the week about 9pm. Pretty empty. There is an outside patio seating area. Would recommend for a cozy date night or calm place to socialize."

    "reviews": "Great place to eat, drink and watch some sports. They are clearly experts in the 3 major food groups : Pizza, Beer & Whiskey. Awesome neighborhood gem that you shouldn\u2019t miss if you\u2019re in Denver. The staff are awesome and have built a special relationship with the community from what I could tell on my multiple stops in on a month long stay in uptown.\nSpecial shout out to my virgo bartender she was definitely maybe possibly totally. Their take on a Chicago style pizza flops. It was good for what it was but not Chicago style at all, it resembles Detroit style more - very doughy, didn\u2019t seem like low moisture mozzarella, and hardly any sauce. Would not order that pizza again. Service was great! Wings with dry rub were the star, delicious. Cheesy breadsticks, just what you want from them... cheesy, very fluffy dough. Moses Pizza was good, not great. However, $9.50 for the minuscule piece of Tiramisu (garlic for scale in photo) was like a slap in the face after spending $80 on food (through Doordash). We questioned whether someone ate 75% of it and left a small corner. That is a ridiculous portion at that price, when all of the food is already quite overpriced for what it is. We love this place. Great atmosphere and service. Really good pizzas and salads. Microbrews and bourbon selections great. They also have some good shot and cocktail options. On a warm day their patio is a good spot to hangout for pizza and beer. The uptown restaurant in Denver was fantastic! The wings were the best I\u2019ve ever had, even better than the ones I\u2019ve had in Buffalo NY at Duffs. In fact, my wife, who\u2019s not a fan of wings ate several honey siracha flavor wings. I prefer the buffalo flavor, but both were fantastic. The pizza is great as well. If you\u2019re in the Denver area and want pizza, this is the place to go. Gluten free folks, they have options for you as well. My wife is gluten free and said her pesto roggota and meat pizza was fire! I had the Moses and added green chili. Top notch!!!"

    "reviews": "Ordered a beer to a dude at the bar, he called me handsome and with a beautiful heart and told my girlfriend that she has a good man. Would be delighted again I believe this  establishment could become more diligent in the area of pool table maintenance regarding the table cloth. Insure all lights above each pool table are in good working order. Implement a  requirement of a charge for alcohol being spilled in the pool tabl. Last but not least, do not allow employees to take photos of a patrons ID on their personal phone for an unpaid bar/table tab!. An establishment can possibly be held reliable for a breach of personal information leading to identify theft which can become a legal matter. Good food, great service, fun pool with friends or even if you come alone you'll have a good time here. The place always has a great atmosphere. Came multiple times and also on St Patrick's Day weekend, the entire bar staff was super attentive and friendly, I had the pleasure of meeting Neely and Brian, both wonderful people. This is literally my go-to spot in Denver\u2014if you\u2019re a pool player that is! You get free pool as long as you\u2019re buying drinks ( I drink pineapple juice \ud83c\udf4d), so it\u2019s a win/win. Unlike other places that charge $1.50 per game, here you get to enjoy a laid-back, slightly grungy atmosphere that feels like a perfect throwback to the \u201990s\u2014think Nirvana, punk rock, and that effortlessly cool dive bar energy.\n\nThe music is a mix of everything, from hip-hop to country, but it leans mostly toward alternative rock, which fits the vibe perfectly. The downtown location is unbeatable, the staff is fantastic, and the crowd is always friendly. Whether you\u2019re here for the pool tables or just the atmosphere, this spot is a 10/10 must-visit for anyone in Denver looking for a great night out! My favorite billards bar in denver. Right next to the convention center and many hotels. Theres always a crowd in here. Always good music. Very hot lady bar tenders. Fair prices. And surprisingly good bar food. I like to sit on the patio and drink."

Hit the wall a few times. Floor is crooked but tables are somehow level. Foosball table wasn't working properly and the reply we got when asking staff about it was \"I don't know\". Wasted money on that. Chicken tenders and fries were decent and came out fast. I visited this bar one winter night with some friends. When we got there, the main door, and the garage door were both wide open with no bouncer. We had completely lost track of time and unfortunately it was close to closing time. There was no bouncer at the door so anyone could walk in. There was 20 minutes left till closing time and It was also freezing outside, so we stepped in just to plan our ride home. As soon as we stepped in the bartender was extremely loud and rude telling us he wasn\u2019t serving. We were looking to get warm and plan our ride home. Then the \u201cbouncer\u201d who looked like a normal customer came up us and tried to get us to leave. I paused because I thought they were extremely rude and really not handling it the best way. They didn\u2019t take the time to listen to us and the way they were talking to us would definitely make anyone feel defensive. The bartender got up from behind the bar and yelled in my face. And collectively the two of them and another man (don\u2019t know what his role is at the establishment) physically pushed me out of the bar and into the patio furniture. Then continued to close the garage door on our face. In no moment did they talk to us calm and nicely. The environment was very hostile and nobody should get talked to this way. That all happened in about 10 minutes maybe less and they left a huge bruise as a reminder. The customer service was not there at all. I understand the feeling of wanting to get off work and also someone walking in right at the last minute. However, our intentions were not fully expressed and not meant to hold up staff from leaving. It\u2019s hard as a customer not to match the staff energy when they are talking to you in such hostile manner. Things would have not escalated if we were greeted nicely from the beginning. I hope the owner knows what type of employees they hired. If you don\u2019t want to get assaulted by the staff don\u2019t go to this bar. Was a nice place to play pool wasn't to crowded and the bartender was chill and the vibes were amazing"

Known as a iconic dive bar of Denver it now hosts neighborhood locals who just wanna go out for an affordable drink and have a great time in one of the most iconic historic bars of Denver. The remodel was essentially a restoration of the historic building which unveiled stonewalls from the 1960s. The bar feels much more spacious with two new bar counters with open garage doors facing Colfax. We sampled the new bar menu which had some exceptional standouts like the cheesesteak eggrolls, the pastrami Reuben, the barbecue chicken rings, and the mac & cheese with pulled pork! Everything is made to order and fresh. Great place to watch a game or experience trivia night on Wednesdays or karaoke night on Fridays. The \u201cTire\u201d is fire!"

If you want good food or prompt service, go somewhere else. If you are looking for a fantastic view and don\u2019t care about the taste or service, check this place out. The one exception to the above is breakfast. Good breakfast burrito and, due to lack of crowd, decent service. Went here on a Friday evening for dinner. Food was good but nothing to write home about. I had the green chili burger. Although it wasn\u2019t busy when we got there they seemed short staffed and couldn\u2019t bus a table by the window so we could sit there. Not a huge thing but it makes my review a 4. The acoustic in this place makes it very loud. I didn\u2019t realize that it was IN the clubhouse so it took us a bit to find it from maps. Signage is not good. The view is very nice. A new favorite patio location! Unbeatable view of the denver skyline and the mountains. Beautiful facility. We dropped in to hit some balls and have breakfast. Ended up deciding to just enjoying the coffee, food and view\u2026 will hit the range next time :-)"

The burger was juicy, packed with flavor, and had just the right amount of sauce. The pickles added a tangy crunch that balanced out the richness of the meat and cheese. The waffle fries were crispy and well-seasoned, perfect for dipping into the side of ranch.\n\nThe atmosphere was warm and inviting, with an industrial-rustic vibe, exposed ceilings, and cozy booths. Service was friendly and efficient, despite the place being busy.\n\nWhether you\u2019re here for brunch, a burger, or one of their legendary pizzas, Atomic Cowboy delivers. If you\u2019re in Denver, put this on your food bucket list\u2014you won\u2019t regret it.\n\n\u2b50\ufe0f Rating: 9/10\nWould I go back? Absolutely. Best chicken wings in Denver. They have homemade food. I also love the Biscuits in the morning. I recommend the Dahlia Biscuit or Tomaha Biscuit if it's your first time trying them. The price seems to be expensive but the food is great. Don't come here looking for cheap food. Pay for your food and enjoy it."

    "reviews": "I can only rate the food because I ordered out. It was amazing. And not like \u201coh I\u2019m hungover this is so good,\u201d like oh I\u2019m bringing meemaw for breakfast here on the last day before greeting the big sky because she has to try the breakfast sandwich. That\u2019s what I had, and my god it was so good. That bun? Finger licken good. Sausage was perfect and I love me a special sauce yes sir! I also had a side of the mini pancakes and they did not disappoint. 10/10 will be back again. Food was good, no problem.  Service was the issue here. It wasn't a huge problem but the most outstanding aspect.\nWe had to flag down waiter who was chatting it up with another staff member, seemingly ignoring the needs of his tables. We left a 17% tip. My companion and I ordered the Blackened Salmon Quinoa Bowl. It was delicious overall. The quinoa hashbrowns were creative and delicious and the vinaigrette I\u2019d love bottled up to take home. The salmon however had minimal seasonings. A big part of why I ordered the salmon dish was for the blackened seasoning. The chef forgot the blackened seasoning. We didn\u2019t feel like waiting as we were very hungry. The server apologized. I at least wanted to let them know so other customers wouldn\u2019t also miss out. Grateful for the kind waitress. Overall good experience with good company. Just the place a couple of jet lagged people needed. The food was absolutely incredible and loved the coffee! The staff were very friendly and polite. The recommendation of the pumpkin pancakes were a delight. Set us up perfectly for a 30k steps day of seeing the city Visited Syrup City Park \u2013 May 22 (Thursday), 10:30 AM \u2013 Birthday Treat\n\nAfter passing by Syrup City Park countless times, I finally decided to stop in for a birthday treat. I ordered the Garcia omelet, one pancake, sourdough toast, and coffee.\n\nFood & Drink:\nThe Garcia omelet was perfect\u2014nicely prepared and flavorful. I\u2019m particular about food temperature, and while the omelet was warm, I was hoping for it to be a bit hotter. Unfortunately, the pancake was disappointing\u2014flat, lacking fluff, and tasted like an afterthought. I know I can make a better one at home. The coffee was also a letdown: lukewarm and off in flavor. It would help to brew it more frequently rather than letting it sit\u2014coffee should be served hot, not iced-tea temp.\n\nAtmosphere:\nI really liked the overall vibe\u2014it was welcoming and cozy. A couple of minor comfort issues: the tables felt a little high when sitting on the padded bench seats, and the chairs were a bit too firm.\n\nService:\nThe young man who took my order\u2014Eric, I believe\u2014was friendly and accommodating. Great service goes a long way, and he made a positive impression.\n\nWill I return?\nDoubtful. I don't expect a restaurant to be perfect BUT for me a few of the key elements are missing that brings me back.  I recommend consistency in the menu choices.  And don't forget the comfort of your guests."

She was very attentive, quick and was always there to get us refills.\nThe food has such great flavor and comes out nice and hot!\nWe ordered the hot and sour and egg drop soup which came out nice and hot with some green onions on top.

The food was great, a nice-sized lunch portion! The staff were friendly, and the restaurant was quiet enough for me to get work done (around 3pm). I\u2019ll definitely be back whenever I\u2019m in the area!\n\nPictured: Pepper steak with broccoli delicious food and surprisingly large portions for the price!\n\ni got the shrimp broccoli lunch deal, and it was soooo good. the shrimp was juicy and delightfully big, the broccoli was good as always, the fried rice was authentic. the sauce was very strong and some may find it overwhelming, but i found it good :)\n\nquiet, cozy atmosphere. the staff were friendly too! 5 stars no complaints Dec 2024\nHave now made this a repeat dining destination.\nHave tried many of their items and have to list my favorites (not in any order):\nSizzling Black Pepper\nBeef\nKung Pao Chicken\nSesame Chicken\n\nService is still \ud83d\udc4d, very welcoming, quick and professional.\n\n------------------------\nMay 2024\n1st visit - Weekday\n\nLunch diners but, seating still available.\nOrdered the Kung Pao Beef but there were other tempting options.\nMeal came with rice and an egg roll.\nIt was delish!\ud83d\udc4c\nPrice very reasonable for food, portion, service and comfort.\nTable service/server was excellent.\nAs it is right by Colfax, I am not sure about parking availability and convenience.\nWill definitely be back!

    "reviews": "My husband and I googled restaurants close to where we were running errands and found this place. It did not disappoint! The staff was very friendly and welcoming. The food was absolutely delicious. The atmosphere was great with great seating and large tvs to watch football. I definitely recommend this place to hang out with friends or a date night! \u2764\ufe0f Neighborhood spot. Hamburgers, tacos, salad, wings, and pizza featured on the menu. Full bar, plenty of beers on tap. Open windows when the weather is nice. Definitely worth a try if you're in the area.. great place to hangout with friends for a meal. Service was quick, seat yourself. Got a ticket for a free appetizer for next time. We had our food delivered. The pizza was excellent, with a perfect crust and flavorful toppings; especially after a reheat on the pizza stone. However, the wings were quite dry. And, the vegetables served alongside them were limp and old looking; definitely not edible. While the pizza is worth trying, the wings could use some improvement. I recently hosted a birthday party there and had the best experience! The staff was incredibly welcoming and made everything so easy from start to finish. A special shoutout to Remy\u2014she went above and beyond to make sure we were taken care of all night. Her energy, kindness, and attention to detail really stood out and made the night feel extra special. The vibe, the service, and the overall experience were top-notch. Highly recommend this spot for any celebration or night out! We got here and walked in and my sister and I actually stopped at the door in awe cause the interior was just beautiful and homey feeling, my phone was dead so I went to the bar and asked an employee if they had a wall plug cause I just have a cord and they had a cord and wall plug and offered to just charge my phone for me and I gladly accepted and they took our order and they food was so good, the meatballs had a lot of flavor and wasn\u2019t overpowering and I had ordered a bacon cheeseburger and I thought the meatballs were good but each dish was truly delicious, I was so full and my head was telling me to ask for a small to go box but my heart was telling me to keep eating\ud83d\ude05\ud83e\udd23"

    "reviews": "This was a great pizza place. If you have kids there\u2019s a ice cream shop next-door and a big artificial grass area where they can run and play in which is beside the points but we didn\u2019t have kids, but it was still OK. We had the pepperoni pizza and we had the barbecue pork pizza and both were really yummy. The large salad is enough to share for three seems like a great place to watch sports as well Essentially a sports bar with pizza and other food. As they don't have personal sized pizzas, I ordered from the brunch menu which is largely breakfast items. The classic is still a lot of food. The bacon and Biscuit were fine. The scrambled egg needed seasoning. The potatoes were okay, but would have benefited from a little onion for additional flavor. A few of them were a bit burned. The best thing on the plate was the berry jam for the biscuit.\n\nService was fine. The space was reasonably comfortable and had a lot of TVs showing various sports. It was very loud from the conversations going on and the music level. They do have guest Wi-Fi.\n\nThe parking lot can easily fill during peak times, but there is on street parking in the surrounding neighborhood. Roni rolls are awesome!! We enjoyed a great lunch special with personal pizza & salad of our choosing. They have a great happy hour selection from 2-5pm. :)\nPizza crust = chef's kiss! Light & crispy! Really enjoyed our time at ester\u2018s tonight. It\u2019s right next to an ice cream place which was kind of cool so we could grab ice cream after dinner. We had a pepperoni pizza half mushroom and we also had a barbecue pork pizza and a large Caesar salad and split it with three. They had ranch dressing, which was really good and the Caesar salad dressing was to die, for. We also ordered some honey to dipper crust in.\nThe place was busy and they had a lot of TVs everywhere so if you wanna go watch sports there, it\u2019s a good place to go for that\nSeems like it\u2019s a popular place for families with kids, which was fine. Keeps the kids busy running around outside while the parents could finish up  dinner. The best specialty pizza in Denver!\nThe Bliss pizza is AMAZING, love the dynamic, umami, savory flavor.\n\nWe love the pizza and typically do take-away only because we\u2019re not really sports fans and so if there\u2019s a significant game-day happening we\u2019d rather let people who enjoy the game come and cheer / celebrate together."

    "reviews": "The pizza here is really good and decently priced. We had the Luau and really enjoyed it. The crust is crisp on the bottom, and the toppings cooked thoroughly. We were very excited to see a deep dish chocolate chip cookie on the dessert menu, but it was disappointing. It is served in a deep dish pan, but the cookie was really thin, overcooked, and stuck to the pan. Had it not been for the ice cream melting on top, it wouldn't have been enjoyable at all.\nWe were lucky enough to get a table right away even on a busy Saturday evening. The service was good and the food did not take too long. I would come back for the pizza and skip dessert. We stumbled across Oblio's while killing some time, waiting on my flight.\nAnd what a good find. They are very friendly staff with good variety Italian food.\nI am still thinking about their spinach and artichoke dip. The baguettes that were served were so garlicky and crispy.\nWe loved our salad and pizza, too.\nI highly recommend giving them a try. First time ordering here. I used DoorDash and my order arrived in a reasonable time still warm. It was absolutely delicious. I got the half-and-half because I couldn\u2019t decide which specialty I wanted. Great option in my opinion to try both. Definitely saved as one of my go-to spots next time I\u2019m in Denver. Oblio\u2019s food, atmosphere and service are terrific. We especially love sitting outside when the weather permits. Such a great neighborhood, nice people. Don\u2019t be afraid to order a take-out dinner, still perfect when you open it at home! Also, the best wedge salad in Denver. \u2764\ufe0f I have never heard of this restaurant and I was shocked. The pizza was really good with great flavors and a crispy crust. The cheesey bread was a hit with the kids. The caprese salad was a good portion size and was yummy. The restaurant is older, needs new tables and light strings, but it did add to the atmosphere."

    "reviews": "Absolutely fantastic experience at Illegal Pete\u2019s! From the moment I walked in, everyone was warm and friendly, making me feel right at home. I ordered a burrito with rice, pinto beans, carnitas, queso, guacamole, corn salsa, savory peppers, and lettuce. Every single ingredient was fresh and flavorful, and the carnitas were especially juicy and tender.\n\nThe portion size was no joke\u2014this burrito was massive! On top of that, the prices were very reasonable for the quality and quantity of food.\n\nThe manager even came out to personally welcome me since it was my first visit, which was such a thoughtful touch. This place truly represents incredible value for the community, and I can\u2019t wait to come back with friends. Highly recommend! Hands down the best burritos I\u2019ve ever had. Super fresh, packed with flavor, and easy on the wallet. The atmosphere here is awesome \u2014 great playlist, live sports on, and a chill bar setup that makes you wanna hang for a while.\n\nSpecial shoutout to Assistant GM Ryan for the hospitality. We\u2019re visiting from Indiana and he made sure we felt right at home. Good people, great food, killer vibes.\n\nIf you\u2019re in Denver and not hitting up Illegal Pete\u2019s, you\u2019re seriously missing out. \ud83d\udd25\ud83c\udf2f $12 for a basically 6 pound burrito and I ate the whole thing.\n\nBetter than chipotle or Qdoba.\n\nPerfect spot if you\u2019re high and need a lot of yummy food.\n\nThe guy making the burrito was amazing. The girl at the bar seemed like she was having a rough day, but pulled it together. Today was mine and my friends first time here and we are on vacation from NC!!! The service was genuine and uplifting!!! The food is delicious and the portion sizes are HUGE!!! My boyfriend and I are vegetarian and had NO problem finding something to accommodate us both. We all got bowls and nachos!!! We will absolutely be back again!!! First time trying illegal Pete during my travel in Colorado. Love the generously overloaded grilled chicken burritos, which is like three times more than my hand! Food is great and everything is fresh. The lady at the bar was so friendly. She guided me to takeout area personally. Park Hill store is definitely a must visit. I am sure I will be back next time."

Service is attentive yet the atmosphere was hectic even early in the morning . The overall experience was enjoyable and I want to go again. A solid choice for a casual brunch or lunch. First time trying this place out at the stanley market! It was extremely busy, which is always a good sign. The reviews did not li. The food was really delicious and great flavors. The server Shawn was amazing! We will definitely be back! Food was amazing. We got the cubano and the lola with an egg added. The diy coffee bar is legit. Service was awesome (Sean served us). The mojo mustard was insanely good on the cubano and the fried chicken on the lola was really flavorful. Great spot. The hype was all it\u2019s hyped up to be. We had the most delicious food here. We ordered almost everything. The Korean biscuit was delicious, the Lola was amazing, the French toast & the cinnamon roll were so soft and buttery. The only disappointing thing was the coffee. Thank you for a great meal! Not recommend the Franklin, the fried chicken is good, veggie gravy and bacon is too salty.\nRecommend biscuit with chicken patty sausage, scrambled egg, with meat gravy. Biscuit is very big"

    "reviews": "I was craving a burger and my hubby discovered this place through TikTok. While it is on the pricier side the food and drinks were fantastic. Almost sad we didn't order more Green Chili tots and truffle fries to take home. Look forward to returning. I'm going to start off with it was $27 dollars per person, our party consisted of 3 adults and 2 children. There was no alcohol consumed. It is a ridiculous amount of money for the quality and quantity of the food, the atmosphere was ok. The food all tasted good but there was nothing to write home about. My bratwurst was oddly skinny, but tasted good. The kids loved the pretzel appetizer. The servers stopped by a few times. It was an okay experience. I enjoyed the atmosphere of this restaurant. My friend and I both got the adult grilled cheese (she with tots, me with salad) and really liked it. The card system for getting beverages is a good one so that a person can only get as much as they want of something. Great brewery! Wonderful place for adults and kids. Outdoor playground accommodates everyone. Such a cool place with a neat concept. I was recommended to check it out and I\u2019m glad I did. Stopped in last night and it was a really warm and welcoming environment. They had a large selection of pay by the ounce drinks. Overall, it\u2019s a great price and experience. Next time I\u2019m in town for work again, I\u2019m be back. Also, the pork green chili is delicious. Very flavorful!"

    "reviews": "Pleasantly surprised at this brewery right outside the Stanley marketplace. I loved that for the morning time they also had a coffee spot open called Mishap Coffee. The inside of the brewery was clean like it had just opened yesterday, with a large separate room that appeared to be a little more professional and picture worthy. They offer flights which is always a huge plus. The outside patio area was the whole reason we came and was nice but covered seating can quickly fill up as the day goes by. There was a decent selection to pick from but my old advice would be to add more options available even if they aren\u2019t on tap and just local breweries by can. Haven't tried any beer yet but the seltzers are delish. Great music choice on a Tuesday night and great ambiance. Will definitely come back. Located about a block from Stanley Marketplace in Aurora, Second Dawn Brewing Co. is the brewery equivalent of that friend who always knows how to have a good time without trying too hard. This spot has quickly become a local favorite of mine... and many people who enjoy a place that is easy to have a good time.\n\nBeer Selection: They have a Flavor for Every Palate\n\nSecond Dawn is a curator of experiences in a glass! Their lineup includes classic flavors along with  innovative brews! For those who prefer a lighter touch, their hard seltzers are awesome! With flavors like the Margarita Seltzer aged in tequila barrels, served with fresh-pressed orange and lime juice, and garnished with a salt rim. Give it a try and enjoy!  Cheers! Excellent Brewery with clean and tasty beer! All of their beers are true to style and taste great. The brewery interior is fun and inviting with multiple different seating options. The exterior has a beautiful pergola for those beautiful Colorado days. On top of all this, the bartenders and owners/brewmaster are wonderful people to talk with and enjoy a beer. I highly recommend stopping in to enjoy Colorado\u2019s best new brewery! I randomly picked up this beer yesterday after seeing it was a Tripel and the ingredients sounded so yum! Was not disappointed! Thank you for supplying to a liquor store in Brighton!"

    "reviews": "Met friends for dinner due to the fact they were there for extended medical treatment at the hospital close to there for her husband. Made a reservation for 6pm and needed to change time to 6:30pm, unsure of how busy they would be. Took me 3 phone calls to advise someone-very snappy lady.\nWalked in at 6:15ish with my friends while my husband found a parking spot. Place was not busy but female bartender was evidently not in any hurry to greet us-had to finally wave her down. Let her know we had a reservation and she said for 3? I advised another person would join in a minute. Seemed bothered by being interrupted and more annoyed when I asked for a booth-we don't have any was the response. Our friend is going through chemo and let her know we needed something comfortable for him. Ugh and a sigh followed and found us a table. Waitress was nice but man oh man do they need a nicer greeter at the front door! We felt like we imposed on the bartender for sure. Walked over on a whim from the hotel without being especially hungry, but ready for a draft beer. The tavern burger was in the top 5 burgers I have ever had, especially the thick ground steak patty cooked to a perfect medium. We also had a wedge salad that was just as good as high end steakhouses serve at double or more the price. Portions were huge. Natalie made us feel welcome, took good care of us, and was darned near psychic for anticipating our every need. A great experience. Excellent place to eat! Service is always kind and great and we can bring our dog to sit outside in the patio area. Highly recommend the nachos and the BBQ Chicken Mac n Cheese. The food was pretty good. We got nachos, pretzel sticks and chipotle chicken sandwich. They have a great selection of draft beer and cider. The mixed drinks were also great. This is the bad place and the people were friendly. It does have the challenge of parking. This is a area close to multiple hospitals and it seems like everything was pay parking. Also new construction so runs a little high priced. If you're looking for a favorite kickback dive bar, this is probably not your place. If you're looking for a quick run-in when you're in the area, it's reasonable."

I had the pork chop and it was good as always. But I\u2019ve had other things on my previous visits and have not been disappointed. Fantastic experience. Had the mussels appetizer and pork chop entree. Portions are generous and flavors incredible.  Atmosphere is warm and inviting.  Reminds me of the best parts of an English country pub. This is the place I bring out of towners for a consistently great time. The best local restaurant someone could ask for! The service is consistently great. The food is awesome and my husband and I love half bottle Wednesday. We go all the time and sit at the bar, have Italian sodas and enjoy the cozy atmosphere and kind people. 1000% recommend. We went to West 29th for Mother's Day. Everyone loved the atmosphere with a vibe that's bigger than the restaurant actually is. We ordered the beef and cheese as well as the mussels for appetizers. The mussels were a swing and a miss, almost bland and of putting. 3 of the 4 of us only had a small dinner serving and we did not finish the dish. But the meat and cheese board was on point! We finished every last bit of the dish. Also, the two appetizers came 15 to 20 minutes apart along with a side that was ordered with the dinner entr\u00e9es. Dining out is not just about the quality of the food but also the experience. That's just bad execution on the part of the kitchen.\n\nFor dinner, my son and I had the pork chops, my wife, the chicken, and Katie the Tuscan braised beef. My son's entr\u00e9e came out minutes after the rest of ours. His plate fresh from the kitchen, mine with cold potatoes after waiting for everything else to catch up. Again, the food was delicious, but the kitchen's execution was wanting.\n\nAnd after dinner we tried ordering some after dinner drinks only to discover half of the drinks we attempted to order were no longer carried. Fair enough, but just take them off the menu\n\nSo all in all, the general consensus was the food was great. Even though the mussels were far from a fac, you can't hit it out of the park every time. The service was good and attentive.  The kitchen and chefs know the food but could do better in the logistics of paying a full meal.\n\nLong story short, we will be back. The food was that good\ud83d\ude01. Probably the most delicious meal we\u2019ve had in a while. Great service, too. Already can\u2019t wait to bring our friends here when they visit us next week. Love the calming and warm ambiance here. Try the salmon and the homemade pasta. Yum!"

The staff is so fun and full of wonderful recommendations. The food is bar food, but still pretty good. Our server in particular was amazing. She got us beer tasters and even mixed a special vesper martini for us because it\u2019s one of our favorite drinks. Check this place out! It\u2019s a sleeper hit. Nice neighborhood tap house. Could do with a few less IPAs and a few more dark beers and sours, but food was great and they even put the game sound up on the big screen per my request. Nice staff good vibes Off the top, let me say that the service is exceptional.  The regulars (Terry, Angie, Stefan) are great and accepting.  Adrianna was fantastic as my bartender, and Greg was hanging out perfecting the experience.  Lots of beer choice (hence the name).  Beer flights available and reasonable priced.  I ate and it was good.  I also checked out other people's food and it looked good.  I need a second visit to give this a 5 star.  STRONG four star for drinks and service, and will wait on my second visit and food for the 5 star review.  During NFL games, there is a crazy Browns fan that will make your day regardless.  He sits on the patio.  Kid friendly, sort of.  Dog friendly also, which is a plus.  I would definitely recommend and see you there. This is a great little place! They have a small patio, and ample tables inside. I was there on a quiet Sunday afternoon, and it wasn't crowded at all. The jalapeno poppers were SPICY, and the sandwiches were tasty. They had a large beer selection, and we found some fun ones to try in the flight. They even had a few GF beer options which made my sister (who has celiac) quite excited! Great spot! Was across the street grabbing a beer at Hogshead brewery (also a great spot) after an afternoon at Sloan\u2019s lake and decided to wander over for a bit to eat. The food was all great, I got the fried egg burger (forget the actual name) and tots but the \u2018twister\u2019 fries were also very good and something I hadn\u2019t seen before. Even had the good fortune of being served by Greg himself (very nice hardworking guy). All around a great place. Check it out!"

    "reviews": "This place deserves a higher rating. I'm Mexican. Los sabores son tradicionales con presentaci\u00f3n contemporal. Mexican flavor with a contemporary presentation. Fabulous place to eat. It blew me away. I'm coming back again and again. I had a green chile C\u00e9sar. Chile rojo enchiladas with carne asada and a mahji fish taco. Everything. EVERYTHING. Was delicious. Huge props to the chef!!\n*Update. Came a second time on a Tuesday and had their $1 tacos served all day and a plate of their Pasta Con Queso. Super good. Taco motha effing Tuesday is hands down the best at this joint!  Small but might!  El Camino is the El Captan of Taco Tuesday!  Simple is the name of the game here.  With $1 street tacos (order as a group from 6-8 different types) and $2 happy hour beers, you will not leave here unhappy.  The vibe is chill and all of the staff is having as much fun as the customers.  It has a hometown feel but a step up from a dive and the food puts it yet another step above.  They have a huge selection of tequila and mezcal to suit any liking.  Also, take special note of the artwork as it changing often and is all for sale from local artists.  I actually own one now.  It gets busy early and they do run out of some of the items if it is slammed so be warned.  I can honestly say I never had a bad taco Tuesday here 6 weeks running!  Happy eating! Wow! Just had this tonight for taco Tuesday after a recommendation, and I am so impressed!  The food was above par for a taco Tuesday $1 street taco menu and the staff was super attentive while in a busy environment and soquest!  The tacos were filled with meat- I tried the carnival, brisket, chicken? and chorizo...no belly ache after ;) The chips were crisp and enough I got to take home and the salsa was a perfect medium blend.  And as a feng shui consultant, I thought their decor and lighting superb!   I will definitely be back and can't wait to try the queso! Amazing staff! (Huge shoutouts to Emma, Nate, Ryan!!). Brunch menu is killer.  1 dollar tacos Tuesday.  Super fun back patio!  Couldn\u2019t love this place more). Delicious food and relatively cheap! Only reason it\u2019s 4 stars is because the taco is a bit pricey for the portion!"

    "reviews": "What a great place, beer was spectacular, staff was friendly and informed.  Real local feel as other patrons were also very friendly.  I have intentions of opening a brewery specializing in cask ales and the owner/brewer took time out of his day to answer questions about the process.  Makes me wish I lived in Denver, I would be here all the time. Came in on a random Monday during the day when I was in town. Treated like family by the staff. Friendly as all hell, great beer, and probably the best casks this side of the pond. Only regret was not having room for the Corned Beef Chili that was brought in for family meal. Will always come back whenever I'm in Denver. Hogshead Brewery is the best brewery around. The beer is excellent and the brew process is so thoroughly thought out by Robert and staff. I had never tried cask beer before and have come to love it. Dave and the team take such good care of their guests and make the environment a fun and easy going place to be. Always good conversation and a good time. Highly recommend! As much as I love the layout and interior + supporting local, the beer was pretty bad. We tried the Gilpin Black Gold, Lake Lightning, 70 Shilling + Chin Wag. Every single one tasted unflavorful and watery. Something significant was off.\n\nI\u2019ve had un-inspiring beers before, but this is a step below and just plain bad. Love the brewery and the locals! Has a ton of cask beers and the head brewer is very consistent! With their new license they also serve other options now besides beer. Definitely one of the best breweries around town!!"

    "reviews": "Decent sports bar, but they should play the game sound instead of music during Nugget games. Grrr. Great place to go to watch games or play games (shuffleboard, ski ball, Golden Tee, Buck Hunter, pool) in the back.  Food is decent, but can't get it to five stars.  We absolutely love coming here to grab drinks though.  Definitely drop in for drinks and snacks!\n\nAdding to review since we just went.  Rating remains the same.\n\nIf you want a cool dive bar and are not expecting white table cloths, then this is the spot.  VERY spacious bar, and you probably can get a seat.  Props to the bartenders for handling the bar with a huge blind spot on the other side.  Stephanie and LJ were great.  Pool tables on both sides, with adds of GTee, shuffleboard, and skeeball.  GREAT spot to catch a big sporting event.  Jukebox for your Sunday Fundays.  HH could be better ($1 off), but I think they always have a Coors bottle special for you to keep in mind (can't verify as I don't drink that).  If you are in a \"game\" mood, this is a premier place for that activity.  Group of friends meeting?  Yup.  I admit to not having the food as of yet, but my buddy told me it is solid.  It is the only dive-ish bar on 32nd Street...with games, so check it out.\n\nNEXT VISIT:\nStrong four.  We go here about once a month to play pool.  We love it.  It would drive me crazy not being able to see the other side of the bar as a bartender, but props to Stephanie for taking care of us like a regular. You know what I didn't know?  They have $6 Titos every day.  And $3 Montucky.  Those two items should be a reason to visit them alone.  $6 is a really good price.  Two pool tables, GTee, skeeball (not sure if that is how you spell it), and really, really cool regulars who welcome you and don't judge you.  I will be honest and say that I haven't tested the food ever, but my buddy, Casey, knows the cook and says it is legit.  Lots of TV's and great place to watch a game.  Definitely recommend and see you there.\n\nMOST RECENT VISIT:\nGot a couple of pics for you this time (without looking too weird).  We love this place.  Admittedly, we still haven't eaten here, but it is Game Central, and the place to have some fun while watching sports.  LJ was our bartender today, and she was handling a RIDICULOUS amount of business by the time we finished pool and closed out, and before her colleague showed up.  Props, LJ.  We felt like the only customers the whole time.  Cool area of town, sports-following crowd, and plenty of space to spread out your group.  Oh, and the \"Game Side\" is the other side (GTee, Buckhunter, Shuffleboard, SkiBall, etc.), but, again, I didn't want to look weird photographing people playing games.  STRONG four, and it will be a five once we finally eat there.  Not their fault.  Great stop in if in town briefly, or living in the hood.  Or, if you just want to drink and look at cute local dogs on the wall.  By the way, Three Dog, I am leaving two pics of my dogs that I would like to see up there (just one of them) next time.  If I see the pic, I automatically make this a 5.  Definitely recommend and see you there. One of the best bars in Denver if you're looking for a place to watch sports play darts and drink some beer. They have an outdoor patio, wrap around bar and an assortment of bar games that will keep you entertained whilst watching your favorite sports games on their many TVs. This is a neighborhood BAR. Not a place where you take children to \u201ceat\u201d. It sounds more like you wanted drinks and you got mad you didn\u2019t get restaurant-level service. It just made me mad seeing this place get a bad review because the bartenders are like family. If you live in the neighborhood, they will know you by first name! Steph is the greatest, Edrick is the damn man, Tony is a DAWG, Josh is a very nice man, LJ is quite cool, Christina always has that look in her eye, Dustin stays churning out delightful dishes, Chelsea is all-knowing and all-powerful.\n\nThe customers are cool too, but we know who keeps this place cooking^^^\n\nWhat are you waiting for?! GET OVER HERE"

    "reviews": "The burgers here are always really good. The onion rings have great breading and are crunchy. We like the hip vibe and love the fact that they have milkshakes here. The only reason I am giving it a 4 star is because we could smell the bathroom from our seats, which isn\u2019t normally the case. Fantastic! Visiting Denver and searched \"burgers near me\", they did not disappoint!! The Kettle chips w blue cheese are Amazing! AMAZING! FAST, FRESH, AND DELICIOUS!\nThe burgers were fast, fresh, and perfectly cooked!\nDefinately stopping again on out next visit!\nFriendly staff, nice dining area. and nicely kept.. Love love loved our food! We were looking for a local burger joint and they did not disappoint! Service was amazing. Food was mouth watering delicious. Everything came out quick and went down fast! Hand down some of the best burgers I\u2019ve had in a long time.\n\nI highly recommend the truffles fries. They\u2019re so addicting you won\u2019t want to stop eating them! Hannah is a very attentive and kind server. We had a quick bite to eat and drinks.\nNate sat us and let us have the window seat and cleaned it for us.\nAlways delicious food and good drinks. We spent about 80$\n2 burgers\n4 drinks\nFries and wings. It seems there are some significant changes happening with the menu, and I wanted to share my thoughts. I'm disappointed to see the bison burger removed, and the new turkey burger recipe doesn\u2019t quite meet my expectations. This restaurant has been a favorite for my family, and we've enjoyed visiting regularly. While I appreciate the effort to innovate, I hope they consider feedback to maintain the quality that made it great for us!"

    "reviews": "It\u2019s order at the front, then they bring the food over to you when it\u2019s ready. The food and vibe is awesome here. I really appreciate their gluten free bread. It\u2019s delicious! The only complaint I have is consistency. There have been times the sandwiches are skimped on the meat making them not at all worth their price, then there are times where they are perfectly made. I would rate 5 stars if I knew every single time I come in I would be getting the same appropriately proportioned sandwich. The pics from below are when someone in the deli is making the sandwiches perfectly proportioned! First timer here! I came with my gal to meet a friend for happy hour. First impressions parking was easy, the restaurant itself is very welcoming and the staff are super friendly. Snagged a couple of seats at the bar ordered some drinks (non alcoholic) and they were all tasty and refreshing.\n\nFor food we split the burger of the month which was a Southwest burger (very delicious) it\u2019s a double so do be aware! My gal is gluten free and so we got GF buns that were very good as well!\nWe also got an order of house seasoned fries and the mussels which were my favorite! Cooked to perfection and seasoned very nicely.\n\nOver all I say 10/10 I would definitely come back and recommend to anyone in the area or for those who are looking for a chill and unique dining experience.\n\nBonus point; it seems like a lot of regulars frequent this spot. Plenty of folks and even the bartenders around us were talking at the bar or at their tables which I thought was super cool. The food was really good. Value, not so much. It\u2019s an order at the counter type of place that has table service prices, with incredibly small portions. Of course asking for 18, 20, or 22% tip. $14 for beets that amounted to maybe one single beet. Caesar salad sandwich was delicious. Only note is more lettuce to make it feel more like a Caesar sandwich. The Ciabatta was fresh and the cutlet was cooked well.\nAlso got the calamari and the sauce we dipped it in was tangy and had great flavor add. TL:DR\nFood was good. Served in a decent time. Would prefer full table service at these prices.\n\nHad the Italian Hot Beef sandwich which was good but not as good as a Portillo's hot beef. Glad I ordered the extra side of Au jus because for what is traditionally and listed as a wet sandwich the bread only had the lightest wipe of Au jus so little that initially I thought they had forgotten it.\n\nMy Dad has the grilled cheese and tomato soup. He loved it.\n\nAlso shared the wings with a side of jerk sauce. Both were good. I can't say I have had wings like that before.\n\nHad the Green chili margarita. I love green chilies but did not like this drink. Finished it because it was $15 but it was rough however everyone has different taste buds.\n\nFood was served quickly but if I am paying $15 for a cocktail and $18 for a sandwich I don't want to have to get up to order or get/refill my water. I know that's just down to personal preference but at those prices I want full service. The staff were friendly\n\nLike the atmosphere and really enjoyed the patio."

    "reviews": "This place is an institution - and for good reason. Walk inside and you are somewhere that feels intensely familiar - even if you\u2019ve never been. Highly recommend grabbing a seat at the bar and ordering a burger and a beer (or two) - their onion rings hit the spot as well. Perfect location for jumping off to games at any of the stadiums or just grabbing lunch downtown. Staff is incredibly attentive and treats you like a regular. Great true Denver spot. The atmosphere is nice inside and outside. On the inside, there is a bar and multiple tables. A large window to the outside. It feels comfortable. On the outside, it's shaded and there are a few tables. Bathroom is clean.\n\nThe food is delicious, the burgers specifically. Cooked a perfect medium, or medium rare. The greens are fresh. The basic burger is under $10, which is impressive and rare. Especially for the taste.\n\nThe service is where this restaurant lacks. We ordered different burgers. I wanted mine without bacon, and my friend wanted his with. We got the reverse. Our waiter was sassy a bit, and I thought maybe that's just his style. It turned out worse, when he called the cook who seemed to only speak Spanish, he kept saying bacon si. We all felt uncomfortable with that behavior, a lack of attempt to communicate or respect. That's how he treats the cooks in front of us, no idea how when we're not there.\n\nI'd come back for the food, if I felt the service has changed. Definite food-gasm.  Simple, delicious, flavorful, juicy, perfect size patty to bun ratio, add your own toppings tray was great plus crispy onion rings. The perfect answer to 'All I want is a good burger'.  152 years in business and still going! Ok, I travel a lot and always try and find places just like this. I'm not always successful,  but I was tonight.\nNot just a Denver icon, but an American icon.\nThere just aren't places like this on every corner, and that's ok, because it would not be special.\nAbsolutely loved it, got super busy as a hockey and baseball game were happening,  but Holy mackerel.\nFabulous,  stupendous,  and just enjoyed every minute.\nPlus they sell girl scout cookies.\nBest place ever. They have 3 different types of veggie burgers. Never experienced that before. So very yummy. My husband said his bison burger was delicious. Terrific service, historic ambiance, and kind vibes. Highly recommend."

    "reviews": "Service was awesome, the food was delicious, and the servers were all very nice. Our server went above and beyond to meet our needs. Dani deserves a raise!!! The fish and chips were amazing. My wife had a single smash, which she loved, and pleasing the wife is not easy, lol  don't wanna forget how clean the whole place was!!! The dry rub wings are SO GOOD. Also get the waygu burger. My new favorite burger spot in Denver.\nWe sat outside and had a great server, we loved coming here. We had a great lunch experience, quick service and knowledgeable waitress. Good selection of tap beers. You can turn any salad into a wrap, which was a great option- definitely recommend! I\u2019ve been here a couple of times and returned because the food is good, but after this last trip I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll be returning any time soon. We put in a simple order - 2 smash burgers and a fried chicken sandwich - and waited for about an hour before the waitress came to let us know that the kitchen never actually started our order. Thankfully they comped our drinks and we were able to go to another place a couple blocks away to eat, but I\u2019m disappointed as it\u2019s a great little neighborhood spot and I love their buffalo chicken sandwich but the spotty service and lack of attention to detail leaves a lot to be desired. I cannot stress enough that this was one of the worst dining experiences I\u2019ve had. I waited an hour for our entrees to arrive. With an app that was maybe 5 pretzel bites. Portion size was terrible.\n\nAfter an hour of waiting to my surprise our waitress placed the check on our table. After looking at the check I found our food was never given to the kitchen. Our order was taken by the waitress then never came out. On top of this already extremely frustrating situation Tap & Burger has an automatic 20% gratuity. Just insane. So this allows the wait staff to do whatever they want as far as service.\n\nFinally, when I asked what happened to our food my waitress insinuated that it was my fault for not asking where my food was. She came by to check on us 3 times by the way and not once did she wonder where our entrees were. Just a disgusting move and some of the worst service I\u2019ve seen.\n\nI cannot recommend ANYONE eats here."

    "reviews": "Recess Beer Garden in Denver is a fantastic spot with a vibrant atmosphere, great food, and an impressive drink selection. The outdoor seating, string lights, and fire pits create a relaxed vibe, perfect for gatherings. The menu goes beyond typical bar food\u2014try the burgers, truffle fries, and pretzel bites. Their rotating craft beers and creative cocktails are a treat. Service is friendly and attentive, even on busy nights. With events like trivia and live music, Recess is a must-visit for a memorable time! I ordered something (beef) with dip. I don\u2019t recall the name of the dish, but it was so delicious. Customer service was amazing. Clean bathroom and nice outdoor. Waitress were very knowledge about their menu. I think you have to pay for parking but I am not sure. I did not pay for parking when I was there but there was a parking meter down the street. 3.5/5.  Great beer garden with good food and a great atmosphere.  Stopped by here to do some work with a friend.\n\nVery fun \u201cslider flight\u201d entree I tried.  It was a fun tasting course, but half of the entree + 1 beer was over $20 before tip.  A bit expensive in my eyes personally. The smash burger is really good, and I like the skinny fries. The Frito pie is pretty good, too. This place is perfection! From size and atmosphere, to service, food and drinks; just everything was phenomenal!!\nWe had a most amazing beautiful Colorado autumn day eating and drinking at this incredible place. The wings, the smothered tots, the nachos, all amazing!!\nLisa was most attentive and friendly and patient and prompt; great server!"

Also may be pricey, but they have a rotating beer option that's pretty great if you don't wanna break the bank and just enjoy the scenery.  Literally our new fave midweek beer place. What a cool vibe! Loved all the knick knacks and toys you can find here. Would totally go back with cash for the vending machine. Even the bathrooms were cool as heck. It\u2019s a great little spot for a late night drink after a good dinner. The atmosphere gets it it\u2019s 4 stars. The waitress kept forgetting us\u2026. Cozy, intimate and bringing an outdoor feel to the city; this is an excellent spot to grab a drink. The elderberry lynx is delicious and available on happy hour.\nThe outdoor seating feels like you\u2019re in the woods, grab a seat by the fire and enjoy. If you\u2019re looking for a cozy and forest themed place for some drinks/food/good vibes with indoor and outdoor seating then come to Forest Room 5!\n\nFood/drinks: The Huckleberry cocktail I drank was up to par. It wasn\u2019t too sweet and had just the right amount of flavor in it. It\u2019s a refreshing choice if you want something light. I also enjoyed the salmon tacos, they were delicious!\n\nAtmosphere: This place has a good amount of indoor and outdoor seating with QR codes where you can look at the menu. The outside area is very unique with lots of plants/trees giving it an earthy vibe.\n\nPrice: The prices here are fairly normal and they do have happy hour deals as well. The cocktail prices were better than what I\u2019m normally used to in other states.\n\nParking: There is street parking available in the area or if you\u2019re close enough, ride a scooter there."

    "reviews": "The service and drinks were top notch. I was intrigued by the variety of ingredients in the drinks that I\u2019m not used to seeing in a cocktail but they were all delicious. Our server Ricky was attentive and on top of everything for our whole visit. I also appreciated that they didn\u2019t let us back until they were ready to seat us and had a guide to our table.\n\nI wouldn\u2019t say the food was necessarily anything to write home about. We ordered the ricotta ciabatta and the burger and thought it tasted fine. The staff was very accommodating as we had a large party and there aren't many large tables. Loved the atmosphere. We tried the scallops, frog legs and bone marrow. Everything was really good, but the drinks were awesome. I had the bartender's choice and they made me a mezcal smoky old fashioned which definitely hit the spot. Our server Ricky was friendly, funny and quick with service. Awesome hangout! This is someplace I would give 15 stars if I could. Jose (our server) made us feel like best friends. He was not pushy and he explained a lot of things on the menu. The drink menu is extremely different from anywhere I\u2019d spent time. The food was simple and executed fantastically. But the big attraction for me was that it really had a cool speakeasy vibe and I am highly recommending this to anyone and everyone. I\u2019ve been to this bar three times so far, every time with a different seasonal menu. Because they change their menus according to the seasons, I wouldn\u2019t be talking about specific drinks, but my overall impression. We usually get 6-8 different drinks every time we visit.\n\nWelcome drink: the welcome drinks are SOO good across the board. It\u2019s also a decent size, not something you can finish with one sip.\n\nBartender\u2019s choice: this is probably my favorite way to drink, since the drinks I\u2019ve asked them to make have surprised me and honestly tasted better than the seasonal ones (not to say the seasonal menu is not good, it\u2019s just that the option to customize a drink according to your likes has more success). Some of the ingredients they use are made by the house. You can also request them to make a drink with a particular base, and the price might range from $18 to above depending on the base.\n\nWhisky selections: they have something of every brand from the UK and Ireland. I was surprised that they had a particular Irish scotch that I was looking for. Definitely a place to go if you like whisky. Also they have a bunch of Japanese whisky bottles.\n\nSeasonal cocktails: although the drinks change according to the season, many of the drinks themselves don\u2019t really \u201cremind you\u201d of the particular season you\u2019re in. That said, the summer menu was definitely lighter and fresher than the autumn and winter menus. The autumn one of 2024 was interesting, and my favorite one was the one with baijiu and sake (I had to mention this one because it\u2019s one of the more unique and nicely mixed cocktails I\u2019ve had in Colorado.)\n\nService: very friendly and professional.\n\nAtmosphere: it\u2019s not actually a hard-to-find speakeasy as the entrance is right on the corner of an intersection. The door to the bar is an actual bookshelf with real books, but the waiting room is not super big.\n\nAppointment: we went once without an appointment and the wait was about 45minutes when we were texted, but then we had to wait about 15-20min more after checking in (this was on a weekend night). When we had appointments and arrived on time, the wait was around 5-10min after checking in. First of all, huge shout out to Kenny for being a fantastic waiter! He was extremely professional and still had us laughing the whole time.\n\nEverything about our dinner at Williams & Graham was wonderful, from the moment we checked in to walking out the door. The staff made us feel so special and welcome, and we even got to sit in a fancy little alcove that made our experience more private.\n\nThe drinks were incredible. I loved my Cloud Cascade (with vodka), but my favorite drink wasn\u2019t even alcoholic \u2014 it was the Passionate Earl mocktail. (I had this drink here a couple years ago and it still holds the esteemed position as my favorite mocktail.) The Tugboat was a big hit with the stout-fans of our group, and the Blackberry Sage Smash was also tasty. As someone who typically hates mezcal, I even found the Sun Sleeper quite nice.\n\nOnto the food: Absolutely loved the roasted bone marrow, which was topped with the most delicious bacon jam. My sister and I did sherry shots with the bones after (apparently a popular thing) and it was honestly amazing; regular shot glasses will now always be boring! The green chile gnocchi was also a hit. My French onion soup was the perfect dinner for a cozy winter evening, and I found it to be a good size for an entree even though it\u2019s technically on the appetizer menu. Other folks at our table greatly enjoyed the burger, mac n\u2019 cheese, and ribeye.\n\nOverall, everything was perfect \u2014 the service, the drinks, the food, the vibes. The staff was lovely; Kenny wished my dad a happy birthday, and a staff member even rushed to give us a phone we\u2019d left at the table on our way out. A place like this is on the more expensive side of our budgets but it\u2019s 100% worth it (and the prices are pretty typical for Denver anyway).\n\nThank you for a fantastic night, Kenny and all staff at Williams & Graham!"

The beer is great and they are always trying something new. Lots of wonderful food trucks on a rotating schedule. I sure do love this place. Fantastic Beers, Friendly Vibes, and Dog-Friendly Atmosphere!\n\nZuni Street Brewing Company is an absolute gem in Denver!\n\nThey offer a fantastic selection of beers, and I can personally recommend the Portly Porter, which was delicious, with rich flavors of coffee and chocolate.\n\nMy partner had the Gingergrass Ale and loved it\u2014light, refreshing, and a perfect balance of ginger and ale.\n\nBoth are highly recommended!\n\nThe staff here are incredibly friendly and helpful, always ready to recommend a brew based on your preferences.\n\nThe locals are just as friendly, creating a great community vibe.\n\nAnd if you\u2019re a dog lover, this place is heaven! Plenty of pups around, all eager for some pets if you\u2019re in need of a dog fix.\n\nZuni Street Brewing is the perfect spot for anyone looking to enjoy great beer and good company in a laid-back, dog-friendly environment.\n\nHighly recommend checking it out! Great atmosphere good beers \ud83c\udf7b will recommend if you in the area to stop by and have a cold one. Great patio This place is awesome! Great live music, amazing beers, good folks & dogs, and great food! Overall, fantastic environment- Highly Recommend. And that bartender-Nate- ain't too bad on the eyes! We stayed at a hotel around the corner from here on a recent trip and spent our first at last nights here. Such a fun and chill brewery with ample outdoor seating and great and diverse beers. One of my favorite spots in Denver!"

    "reviews": "In town, so we decided to visit a recommendation from Chef Guy Fieri. He was right, classic, good tasting pub food. It was delicious. The service was a little bit lack luster. The bartender seemed preoccupied with not being there. Three of us had the pastrami Bombshell with tavern tots and were blown away with the generous size and awesome flavor of the sandwich. The tots were also fantastic! I had the turkey sandwich on brioche and it was fabulous! The owner came out and chatted with us- super friendly, as was our waitress! Definitely will be going back the next time we\u2019re in Denver! I would go on a Saturday night. The food was great. Came out hot. The atmosphere was very nice not too loud. You could still have a conversation. The tavern dip is made with pastrami which is fantastic. The Tots were cooked. Well not over cooked. Parking isn\u2019t too bad. Did have to park a little bit away but very doable. Very unique vibe. Has the feel of a local bar or a classic Denver dive bar but with way better food lots of TV to watch sports. Music was good and not too loud. We had a great waitress who took care of us. I had the bombshell, macaroni and cheese, tater tots, a salad and my wife had a turkey sandwich. We we're at a VB tournament in CO Jan 31-Feb 2, we went here to eat, first of all the owner of this place is spot on, nicest guy ever. He made us feel like his family. The tots are fantastic as well as the pork rinds. The food was terrific. We liked it so much we brought our whole team back there to eat. This place is a must go to!"

    "reviews": "The absolute rudest bartenders I've ever met. Completely unfriendly bar atmosphere. Don't come here if you want a fun vibe.\n\nWhat you need to fix? Be more friendly, welcoming, and learn some people skills. Nice and cozy cocktail spot with friendly and knowledgeable staff. The decor offers a great ambience, and the food is some of the best bar food I've had as far as dive/tavern-style bars go. I highly recommend the tater tots.\n\nThe back patio area during the summer time is also a wonderful vibe.\n\nDefinitely gets crowded for New York games, but otherwise a great spot to grab a few drinks with friends. Bartender thought I should not be served anymore. Instead of giving me a water and saying no, he charged me 35$ without the option of a tip and said he served me a double. The whole drink was water. If this isn\u2019t fraud I\u2019m not sure what is. Shameful. Fun little neighborhood bar in the Denver Downtown area with a New York football Giants and 70s/80s punk rock theme.  Even though I was visiting during a Giants game on a Sunday afternoon it was fairly busy but not overly packed. I enjoyed myself and think it could be a great night out with friends. I don\u2019t believe the prices match the environment, though they do match the stellar service. Just kinda comes off as grungy and down to earth, but then charge you $23 for supposedly affordable Buffalo trace and 1 egg/ham sandwich. Food is expensive these days I guess, but $11 for Buffalo trace had me not eager to return. Praise still due to the kindness and attentiveness of the servers. Maybe it was the just the wrong night to see a strangely upscale crowd (not fancy yet expensive clothes types) in a location that looks grungy as heck with the raise fist painted out front - you know the contradiction well if you\u2019ve seen it. Maybe I\u2019ll drop through again but hard to say since I moved from the area, but they probably deserve a second chance."

Their Social Darts takes the classic game to a whole new level\u2014it\u2019s fast-paced, automatically scores for you, and is perfect for groups of 2-12 (or 13+ with event booking).\n\nWhether you\u2019re a darts pro or a total beginner, the vibes are amazing, and it\u2019s impossible not to have a good time.\n\nThe food was incredible\u2014highly recommend the Guacamole with Jalape\u00f1o Powder, Buffalo Chicken Sliders, Chicken Skewers with Mango Chutney, and the Burrata Flatbread with Balsamic Reduction. These dishes were beyond delicious!\n\nAnd let's talk about dessert! Caramel-filled Churros? Just WOW.\nFor cocktails, the Lavender Lemonade with Empress Gin stole the show\u2014it\u2019s a must-try!\n\nCan\u2019t wait to come back again. Thanks, Flight Club, for such an unforgettable experience! Enjoyed a light appetizer \"meal\" with cocktails. We did not rent any darts but we did enjoy our time in the main sitting area. The location is smaller than the one in Chicago and there are only darts (no ping pong). Plenty of areas for groups to enjoy a few games. It did get a bit loud, as people screamed out, while playing darts. Our server was super friendly and helpful in giving us the service we needed (dietary restrictions). The mocktails were a bit pricey ($20, with tip). Would recommend as a place for parties We came here for NYE and it was absolutely perfect. Not too crowded, wonderful service from the bartenders and especially from Dakota who took excellent care of us at our dart station! I had questions about some gluten free items and a few other things; he was incredibly accommodating and if he didn't know the answer, he went and got one. His service was quick and always with a smile! When we come back, we will definitely be requesting his section!\n\nWe didn't participate in the NYE tickets (just tickets for the dart booth), so couldn't eat at the buffet or participate in the dart events, but it looked pretty good and that people were having fun. They did serve complimentary champagne for a toast at midnight and what was nice is that it was a full glass of champagne and in an actual champagne glass. It may see small, but not being handed a plastic glass with a drip of champagne in it really made the whole celebration feel a bit more upscale and meaningful.\n\nThe bathrooms and facility were clean, the temperature was comfortable, and the food we got (brussel sprouts, fries, and a couple other appetizers) came out hot and delicious. For those of you needing to eat gluten free, there are plenty of options (although I do think they have shared friers). The sprouts were my favorite and I could not stay out of them.\n\nThanks to everyone at Flight Bar for such a great night! We will be back! Super cool spot to throw darts and a few drinks down. Make sure to reserve in advance, tried to hit this place a day prior to when we went but they were totally booked. High quality dart boards, especially for having electronic scoreboards and getting to use metal tipped darts. We went to Denver Flight Club with a group of friends, and it was such a great time! The dart games were so much fun, with a variety of game options that kept things fresh and exciting. We all wished we could have played longer because it was such a blast!\n\nThe food and drinks were excellent, too. The Expression Martini was absolutely delicious, and the appetizers were perfect for sharing while we played. The atmosphere was lively yet relaxed, making it an ideal spot for a group outing.\n\nDenver Flight Club is the perfect place for fun, food, and friendly competition. Highly recommend it for your next night out!"

    "reviews": "We really enjoyed it here. Interesting food options. Chicken sandwich was really good. The old fashioned for $8 was far better than the $15 foxy or foxhattan\u2026 Also the sun hits just right on the outdoor bar table for the colder months. The food is so good. I ate it before I could take a picture. The drinks and the service team are awesome. The only reasons I'm giving 3 stars is because the girl who greeted us when we first walked in was a bit rude and seemed like she had better things to do than answer our question about seating availability either downstairs or upstairs. This was our first time here. It also took about an hour for us to get our food. Our server, Nick, was awesome though, he made sure to keep us updated on the food situation. He said the kitchen was behind and catching up, which was fine, I knew they had quite a few large groups upstairs that they needed to take care of. But Nick was very attentive and made sure our drinks were refilled while we waited. When our food finally came out, it was very good, prepared very well! I ordered the Ahi tuna bowl and he ordered the Chicken & Waffles. My tuna bowl was amazing! Overall a pretty good place, although I'm not sure if we'd come here again or not, but it was an okay first experience. Great service and definitely a notch above your average bar fare. We stopped here for lunch on our way out of Denver and all enjoyed our meals! It's close to Coors Field and really stands out as a pre-game destination. The wait staff was great and the interior was unexpectedly nice and cozy. We started with the fried cheese curds, because, why not! :-) They were beer battered and delicious with some added goodies: fried pickle chips and fried jalapeno rings. We also had the Buffalo Cauliflower, which had a mouthwatering tangy buffalo sauce and some carrot shavings to go along with the ranch dressing. The mains were yummy, but the standout was the Cajun Turkey Gouda sandwich on a Hawaiian bun. Yum! Second to the turkey sandwich was the Shrimp and Grits that were also excellent! Yummy and delicious grits with plenty of cheesiness and some nicely seasoned shrimp to go with them. After that, the Portabella Burger was okay, but the mushroom could have been fresher and was a bit thin. The Glazed Sprouts were good, and there was an appropriate amount of balsamic glaze, but they also could have used a bit more seasoning outside of the glaze. All in all though, a great dining experience in a great location for game day! This place is awesome!\nI recently travelled to Denver from the UK and my wife found this bar.\nThe whiskey range is great, the staff are really knowledgeable and friendly, while the food for a bar is also great.\nThey show all the sport games too.\nThe happy hour is good and above all the prices are reasonable as most places in Denver are so pricey.\nCan't recommend this place enough!!!\n\nDefinitely get the buffalo cauliflower! They are insanely good."

    "reviews": "TERRIBLE AND RUDE MANAGMENT. False advertised happy hour specials, and then when asked for clarification. The MANAGER responded very aggressively saying \"what're you gonna do about it!? sue me!?\" . He yelled at several other customers that evening and created a very hostile environment.  I was heavily triggered by the manner in which is spoke to me, which was totally uncalled for. His demeanor towards me was so intense that a bystander had to step in to try and help, and then he got yelled at too.\nKey takeaways:\n1. Don't trust the drink specials- they will charge you full price and steal your money\n2. Management is incredibly aggressive and rude\n3. Also the fries suck\n\n0/0 stars - will NEVER return, and urge others to avoid as well Good food, good service, busy atmosphere, no kids seating.. bring your stroller or take a booth if you bring your kid.  The whiskey sour was good. Great sports bar, especially Boston games. Had a great experience during a Celtics playoff game sitting at the rooftop bar. Plenty of TVs inside and on the roof. Paulie was an amazing bartender, very attentive and personable. Chicken tenders were solid. 100% recommend this bar for a big game, bar food, or rooftop vibe Kitchen is nothing to brag about with almost nothing to choose from. Order Guinness and it didn\u2019t even come in a Guinness glass. The only person I saw working is a bar maid who said if we want to order something come to the bar. Just not impressed at all with this place as a \u201cPub\u201d. I have been coming to Pour House for a while and the staff has always gone above and beyond. I was in attendance when this occurred.\n\nTyler and Sandra left out some details  details:\n- they started the arguments with the staff\n- this occurred during March madness final 4  NC State Game when the bar was hosting NC State alumni.\n-   The bar offers QR codes all over the bar top a little search to the specials never shows one on Saturdays."

    "reviews": "Fun rooftop spot for pregame drinks or sunny-day hangs! This is a great place to pop into before a game or when the sun\u2019s out. It can be a little tricky to find, enter through Hayter\u2019s, show your ID, and head up the stairs on your left. Once you\u2019re up top, you\u2019ll find a shaded rooftop with misters to keep you cool and a laid-back vibe.\n\nThe menu offers a solid selection of Colorado beers, mixed drinks, and even a nice array of non-alcoholic options. I loved the Fire Island, refreshing and flavorful!\n\nWe grabbed some food while we were there. Unfortunately, my husband didn\u2019t enjoy his burger, and the fries were underwhelming. They were also sold out of onion rings, which was disappointing. I went with the Philly quesadilla with steak and highly recommend subbing in cheddar cheese. It made for an amazingly ooey-gooey, cheesy treat inside a crispy tortilla. Too bad the server forgot to provide napkins!\n\nA few things to be aware of:\n\nThere was an attendant in the bathroom, which we weren\u2019t expecting.\n\nPeople were walking around promoting online gambling apps, which added a different kind of energy to the place.\n\nThe crowd was mixed, and since it was pregame, there were more Yankees fans than Rockies fans that day.\n\nAll in all, it's a fun stop for rooftop views and drinks we'd definitely return with friends and family! The chicken Philly was amazing! Love that they only have mixers and beer from CO. That is really cool! Great views, and great service. The atmosphere is such a vibe. The rooftop had lots of heaters and a fire pit which was wonderful for a cool night. They were easy to work with in coordinating our work event. The service was attentive even though there were a lot of us. Had an unfortunate experience yesterday where a girl we didn\u2019t know got attached to our group. She was wasted and got weird. The bouncers and manager were really cool about having her removed politely and were trying to be helpful. She got aggressive and they were a lot nicer than she deserved. In the chaos of trying to get this girl into an uber my friend left her purse inside. Once we realized this we walked back and Bob was already outside trying to find us to return it. So grateful for Bob and the rest of the amazing staff! Thank you! Love the outside seating option with table umbrellas and misting to keep things cool... service was fast and friendly.. great sour and cider drink options.. the food was excelled"

We sat at the bar. I had a couple of draft beers, and my wife had cherry limeades. Nachos, sliders and pretzels were pretty good. Buffalo chicken sandwich had some kick to it! Fresh food and good flavors.  The atmosphere was great! It's a huge place that sprawls around, up and outside.  We didn't realize it until we had to look for the bathroom!

I have been here multiple times, and had three work events here and all have surpassed my expectations. The staff are warm, friendly and knowledgeable and you can\u2019t beat their rotating taps on their beer wall.\nShout out to Pierce for being an incredible manager and so easy to work with. And to Sawyer who has bartended every event I\u2019ve planned.\nYou need to go here if you haven\u2019t already!!! I thought this place was amazing.  While expensive, this place had really excellent food - especially the carnitas and their pork egg rolls.  Tacos were better than many of the taco restaurants downtown.\n\nBeer selection was good and great.  Still expensive, but being able to have a really finite control of the beer I get is great!  Can have 6 or 7 tasters in 1 sitting! Great variety of beers to choose from, including a couple ciders & wines.  We loved the atmosphere. The self pour portion is definitely worth going to check out. The concept is really cool! Pay per oz. Staff was really great! My one downfall was not a lot of vegetarian options & menu items cannot be altered. That was a bummer. The cauliflower wings are so good. You need to get the honey jalape\u00f1o Sriracha sauce. How far is grilled and not deep fried so it\u2019s a whole different hit and it\u2019s a lot healthier for you."

If you love a good cocktail do not skip this spot!\n\nAmazing food, drinks, and service! As avid espresso martini lovers my girlfriend and I felt we had to try this place. We tried the flight and the espresso martini with the whipped coffee. The whipped coffee was a pleasant surprise that gave a light flavor that you enjoyed more as it melted. Very cute boutique hotel bar.  Creative craft cocktail list, very focused on gin and vodka martinis.  I had the raspberry beret.  It was delicious. I had such an amazing experience with my girlfriends here. It\u2019s the perfect spot for a great drink and good conversations. The atmosphere was calm and upscale. My friends and I were treated\nSo well by Champ I believe his name was. We tried their Dubai espresso martini and it was beyond amazing. The perfect spot for an evening out !

    "reviews": "The wings sucked and the $8 fries came with an egregiously little amount. The poke bowl came with rice that had been sitting out for what must have been a long time with fishy tasting tuna. The avocado in the poke bowl also looked very gross. The loaded fries were also a laughably small amount. Over priced food. If you want to watch a game here and grab a drink you will probably like the place. If you\u2019re coming here wanting to eat good food and get a decent portion for the cost, not the right spot. Firstly, I used to live in Minnesota and attend the Tom's there but the atmosphere here, location and the service is top notch. The managers, servers and hosts are so attentive to you and make sure you're served quickly even in a big crowd. How can you not be fired up about Rockies game day and Toms Giveaways? You might be crazy. This has been a highlight of my trip!!! I had an amazing experience at Tom\u2019s Watch Bar, and a huge part of that was thanks to Daisy. From the moment we were seated, she was attentive, friendly, and incredibly knowledgeable about the menu. Daisy made great recommendations, checked in regularly without being intrusive, and handled everything with professionalism and a smile. Her energy really elevated the entire experience. If you\u2019re visiting Tom\u2019s, I highly recommend asking for Daisy\u2014you won\u2019t be disappointed! We had solid cocktails, great burgers, and watched a helluva match-up between Denver and Cincinnati for a playoff spot. The game was a nail-biter, and Tom's crowd made it that much more exciting! The outcome was a letdown, but the time spent was wonderful. Highly recommend on game day...or any day. Oh, and our server, Sofia, was all over it! Super busy and she still crushed it. Well done. The environment was amazing. Good space between the tables. My favorite appetizer was the spinach artichoke dip and our waiter, Isaak, is a 10/10. He makes sure you\u2019re aware of all the best things on the menu and pricing and is super attentive!"

    "reviews": "Well, for  a base burger, the price of 12.95 is extreme.  You get nickel and dimed for everything.  Son wanted a shake.  Anything you want in it is an extra .75. Fries were mediocre. Tater tots had no seasoning. 4 bucks was not worth it.  I got a burger bowl. You pay extra for cheese, 4 bucks for bacon but it was bits not strips. Service was a 3 out of 10. She had about 10 tables to handle.  Not her fault but you then tend to ignore others.  Didn't ask how the food was.  Didn't ask if we needed anything else.  Oh,  only if I wanted another beer. Then they put on a 3.5 % fee for non tipped employees. You can ask to remove it but why do I need to ask that?  So, that right there lowers my servers tip, not just cause she wasn't worth a 20% tip but Denver restaurants think it's cool to add these fees. Talk to the major of Denver to fix that.  To make us pay.  This is the last time I will be coming and many friends as well.  In&out has you guys beat on every category.  You going to charge a premium price then I expect excellent service, and food. Nick was super awesome! Very friendly! Service was great, table was always cleaned quickly of old drinks and food. Will be back for Nick. Thanks for being super attentive and on point with your customer service!! Met up with coworkers at the Ballpark location for happy hour and had such a great experience! Our server, Fitzgerald, was incredibly personable and took the time to walk us through the menu since it was the first visit for many of us. His recommendation of the Wildest Dream cocktail was spot-on.. and his love for Taylor Swift was the cherry on top! The atmosphere was warm and welcoming. We\u2019ll definitely be coming back \ud83d\ude03\ud83c\udf7b Burger was good, but the \"$12\" burger was actually $18.50 and then the fries are $4 on top of that. AND a \"service fee\"!! Absolutely insane people pricing things here. Here's the receipt so you can decide for yourself if a bacon cheeseburger is worth 4 years' salary. Great spot. I've been wanting to try this place for years & found the time to go.\n\nBurgers are super customizable, but they also offer a set menu of burgers. Burgers are juicy, well portioned, & offer a ton of flavor. The only complaint is I wish they kept some salt at the table for the fries.\n\nThe ONLY okay thing about the meal was the Spanish rice. It was okay, not terrible, just okay. But since you're at a burger restaurant, I guess it was my bad for getting it\n\nThey must have spongebob back there with the tri-spatula whipping up these mean burgers. That's the only way I can explain how they get this many tasty burgers out"

    "reviews": "Just an fyi, children are not permitted downstairs (not sure if there is a cut off time if they are at some point) though they have to be out by 8pm, in case you have crumb snatchers erm kids with you. Live music started at 8pm. Another great spot to drop in at if in the RiNo district. Definitely would like to go back to check out the downstairs games. They had life size corn hole, beer pong, jenga, connect 4, etc. They do have das boot with is like 2.5 liters or maybe 3 liters of beer. Such a cool place! We were with kids and the place is kid friendly upstairs, but downstairs is 21+ and they have adult games and the atmosphere is awesome. I will definitely visit without kids and hang out with friends there  \ud83d\ude0d food was tasty and the beer was very delicious too! My group and I got here at the end of the night. We had drinks and they were just okay. The atmosphere was really nice and it\u2019s a nice place to go to play games, have drinks, and hang out.  The place really is massive. The food is alright but nothing special. Not the most authentic German food. We really liked the live music although the tables were way too close to the games area and our table got hit with balls multiple times. Also, the seating area around the stage was a bit lacking. First time I ever went here was for a vendors market that my wife and I were vending. I was mind blown at the place and how big it was. All the staff was super friendly, I wish I had a chance to try the massive pretzels that they display as soon as you walk in, but next time! It would be very cool place to watch sporting events as they had a massive projector going. I\u2019ll definitely see myself coming back to this place in the future."

Even though the Dog wasn't Fancy,it was a Quarter Pound Fatty,and pretty tasty once you loaded it up with you Onions,Relish,Etc. I had such a good time,I almost blew the game off. Of course I had a $12 ticket,lol.\nFar better than that lame place called Belles and Boots a couple doors down that charges almost $7 for the Coors Draft alone.  If you're a simple man like me, you'll love it here! The mac and cheese was incredible! The waitress was nice and friendly. Great spot to stop by before a Rockies game Best place to go before and after a Rockies game! Our waitress Savannah was fantastic! Good prices, good food, good music and good service! Great little sports bar. We popped in for a quick bite before a concert, caught the end of the nuggets game, & enjoyed a drink with friendly service. I've never seen my husband not eat or be surprised by the spice level of wings..EVER. He LOVES heat in food. The spicy buffalo this place offers HUMBLED him! He was floored but very impressed! Would definitely come back! Great place to enjoy several drinks and tasty food before and after a Rockies game. Staff were great especially Savannah (apologies if spelling is incorrect).\nOne of the best bars I have been to on my many baseball trips. \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udf7b\ud83e\udd43"

The mini hot dog specials (Mondays- choice of chili cheese or Chicago) even had the SNAP of a good dog. Fantastic vibe and service. Get out here. Oh and they do have a small parking lot, so no excuse. Favorite neighborhood spot for beers, pizza, wings, and sports.\n\nTheir pickled flatbread pizza is my favorite thing in their menu. Get some chipotle ranch to go with.\n\nCalifornia Reuben caught me off guard with how great it was. I tried their JP pizza a while back and loved it. Tried it again a few days back and it wasn\u2019t as good anymore, or maybe i remembered it wrong. I tried 4 dofferent pizzas, they were all meh. Prices were also insane. Cart driver in the area is more famous and even cheaper with way better dough Came from out of town, this was right next to our BnB, and I'm glad it was! The food was crazy good, and the beer was solid as well. Service was fantastic, and I'm looking forward to coming back! Had a great meal! Pizza rolls to start were great.  Beautiful presentation and great flavors.  The small Cobb salad was definitely a meal itself.  Blue cheese dressing was fantastic and again the presentation was wonderful.  Staff was very friendly and service was on point.  Really enjoyed the patio and look forward to visiting again, soon."

Funny enough, I actually met some of my neighbors from the building at the bar\u2014it\u2019s that kind of place. You walk in and feel like you\u2019re already part of something.\n\nI celebrated my birthday here recently, and it couldn\u2019t have been a better choice. Mike and Dave, the owners, are the chillest bar owners I\u2019ve ever come across. They\u2019ve created a space that feels welcoming, laid-back, and genuinely fun. You can tell they care about the people who come through the door, and that makes all the difference.\n\nThe ambiance is solid, but it\u2019s the community that really makes Pairadice stand out. On Wednesdays, the bar is taken over by a friendly crew of chess players who\u2019ve even taught me how to play. Thursdays are for music bingo, a nostalgic throwback to high school that\u2019s always a good time. Whether you show up solo or with friends, it\u2019s the kind of place where strangers turn into familiar faces.\n\nPairadice is exactly what you want in a neighborhood bar\u2014comfortable, unpretentious, and full of good people. They have a decent house Tequila. I ran in before a Sublime show and grabbed a less expensive shot. Prices are fairly reasonable. Okay,\nThis place is honestly THE BEST.\nI came here bc some bartender at the Welton room recommended it, and that was the BEST decision ever. Daniel was AWESOME, and I mean A.W.E.SOME. We came for happy hour only and stayed the whole time because the music, the comedy and the atmosphere was sick. Daniel is hilarious. Not too shabby on the eyes, and jsut all good vibes all around.\nCan\u2019t wait to come back. Stumbled upon a gem here. If you\u2019re looking for a chill night out, I highly recommend Pairadice! Great drink menu, with a happy hour that features $1 off drafts, $5 wine, and $4 well drink. The atmosphere is very relaxed, with dart boards and corn hole. Music bingo adds a unique twist to the usual bar games, making it a great way to unwind with friends. Overall, it\u2019s an awesome spot for a casual night out. Highly recommend! PS Mike and Dave, the owners, are genuinely the best humans. Fun dive bar. The bartender handled it large group with expertise. Great mixed drinks, good beer selection. The patio was very nice with Cornhole and lots of seating. Great vibe inside, too!"

I had a frozen strawberry tequila lemonade drink which was excellent, but listen to me when I say you HAVE to try the purple kool-aid hard seltzer. It was so good, we bought two crowlers of it. The food was excellent too, and the music was amazing! Siiiiiick atmosphere. Customer service is 1000/10. Beautiful & tasty drinks. Love the ultraviolet seltzer. Would come back anytime and tell all of my friends about it! Kurt is an awesome bartender. Great place for some music and beer. The staff were great, plenty of seating, great jazzy music, and great drinks and beer. The crab lobster boil was absolutely delicious. Conveniently located in the plaza and light rail stop as well. Worth a stop! Just dropped back into spangalang after a long absence and was immediately recognized by Erica (she's fire). Ive been working my ass off and its time to jist enjoy a vibe with no expectations. But anyway, the vibe was good on what was a multipurpose night. They had Latin jazz earlier and no w we are in the hip hop portion of the night. All vibes are up and open as everyone is intermingling. Hey it's Denver, we all mix and match here. The crowd is cool, only thing missing is food but it's easily remedied by local establishments withing walking distance and the occasional food trucks. So good vibes all around, stop on and enjoy. Cool little brewery with good beers that are always changing. Always love a brewery that likes to change the beer up from time to time. There was no food or snacks but definitely a cool place to stop during the day. I believe they have some live music from time to time as well as some trivia but was not there for that unfortunately. If ever in the area will stop in again and try their new beers."

    "reviews": "STEM Cider - A RiNo Gem You Cannot Miss!\n\nSTEM Cider has earned its place among Denver's must-visit destinations. This isn't just another cider house \u2013 it's a thoughtfully crafted experience.\n\nWhat Makes STEM Cider Extraordinary:The Cider Selection. The star of the show is undoubtedly their cider list. Finding truly exceptional gluten-free options can be challenging. STEM Cider doesn't just accommodate gluten-free needs \u2013 they celebrate them. Their house-made ciders are crafted with precision and creativity that rivals the best breweries in the city. Each pour tells a story and you definitely have options, single poor, or their flights.\n\nFood That Surprises and Delights-I walked in expecting good cider and left plotting my return for the food alone. Every dish exceeded expectations with flavors that complement their cider selection perfectly. The menu made me want to order one of everything \u2013 a rare occurrence that speaks to both creativity and execution. The kitchen clearly understands how to balance flavors that enhance rather than compete with their signature beverages.\n\nThe staff here deserves special recognition. Knowledgeable, inviting, and genuinely helpful \u2013 they elevated the entire experience. Whether you're a cider novice or enthusiast, they guide you through their selection with expertise and enthusiasm that's infectious. This is hospitality done right.\n\nSTEM Cider sits perfectly within RiNo's vibrant ecosystem, connected to surrounding businesses through a charming center court concept. This creates a unique community feel where you can easily hop between different experiences. The outdoor seating takes full advantage of Colorado's incredible weather and the district's energy.\n\nSTEM Cider represents what makes Denver's food scene special \u2013 innovation, quality, and community. They've created a space that works equally well for locals discovering their neighborhood and visitors experiencing authentic Denver culture.\n\nSTEM Cider delivers an experience worth planning your day around. For Denver locals: This is your new regular spot. For visitors: Add this to your must-do list immediately.\nSTEM Cider isn't just serving great cider and food \u2013 they're creating community, one perfectly crafted experience at a time.\nRemember, if it\u2019s great-we be at it! What a cool vibe . Amazing ciders ( loved the peach one and raspberry lime ) . Delicious food. We had the crispy tofu and spicy mushrooms with fries . Everything was fresh and yummy. We will definitely be back. Ordering via phone for a group was kinda wonky.  Went there for the cider but stayed and will come back for the food. The shareables were huge and delicious. We got poutine, wish I asked for double bison because the meat was fabulous, some Brussels and the bravas(potatoes with yummy sauce) This place is awesome. I love ciders but they arent super common on menus, so to have such an incredible selection on tap was a dream! That aside, the staff are super kind. Just great people. And the atmosphere couldnt be any better in peak spring, when trees in smelling distance around the patio seating are all in full bloom! So pleasant. I also appreciate the vegetarian/ plant based food options available. The sweet potato fries were  perfectly made, addictive. And having a beyond burger option is appreciated. I am not often in downtown, but when I am, I try at least one of their cideries to see what the buzz is about.\n\nStem is probably one of the better ones I have tried in recent years down here. Though they are a struggle to get to (thanks inner-city navigation!), they got the place all laid out for your arrival. They also repurposed some deli coolers to serve you some packs ice cold if you wanted some on the go.\n\nWe decided to also try the food while we were here. The truffle fries were okay, definitely not something I'd recommend coming here for."

    "reviews": "overall wonderful experience! my boyfriend and i stopped in here for a couple cocktails, oysters and a lovely cheeseboard. the presentation of the food and drinks was incredibly thought out and well done. although i am a huge oyster fan and have had my share of them from many restaurants, the mignonette at this place was other worldly. our server told us they change up the flavors quite frequently, but i can only imagine that they are all good! typically i load oysters with cocktail sauce, and when it wasn\u2019t served i was shocked, but the mignonette was so delicious, you don\u2019t even need the cocktail sauce. definitely give this place a try if you are from/in the denver area! Menu is concise and impressive. Everything feels very refined and tailored while still retaining a neighborhood-friendly vibe. Incredible wine list and incredible service (thank you Ashley!) Everything here is good, but not great. Service was the same. They brought me the wrong wine, which happens, but I wasn't able to flag them down and so by the time I could talk to the server it was late in the dinner so I had to chug my glass and they didn't offer to comp it or anything. Which I understand, but at restaurants charging their prices I'm used to a different level of service.\n\nOn every dish there was something great and then something mediocre. For example the bone marrow was great but only came with two pieces of bread which were a little overcharred in my opinion. Again tried to ask for more but by the time I could talk to someone we were basically done and then only offered a plate of 4 pieces of bread.\n\nThe clams and gnocchi dish had perfectly cooked clams and gnocchi but the crackers were very soft and the broth was just ok.\n\nRabbit pasta tasted delicious but was much more figs than rabbit so it overwhelmed the flavor of.\n\nAgain happy with everything but not 5 stars. You'll have a good time, but not rave, just not memorable overall. Every dish was excellent and service was above average.  Venue not bad but relatively average.  Will definitely make it on to our regular list next to Molotov, Sap Sua, and Wildflower. Fantastic intimate restaurant with some great food! Had a party of 6 for a Birthday dinner and decided to try Point Easy for the first time and they didn\u2019t disappoint. The drinks were great and the food was even better. Highly recommend the bolognese! Oysters were great, the bison was delicious and those fries were addictive. Great place and will be back!"

    "reviews": "First timers. Nice hotel dinner spot. Beer and food. What more do you need. Had a berger and fries and side salad. Took about 10 minutes to cook. Not long at all. Good service, and much better quality food than a typical hotel  buffet breakfast. Ordered the Inncredible Salad with steak. Steak was good however, the selling point of the salad for me was all the additional items on the salad. I did not get the shredded carrots, gargonzola, candied pecans, nor dried cranberries on my salad. Furthermore, the waitress almost seemed confrontational with my boyfriend, rolling her eyes after he placed his order and then asking \"why are you mad at me?\" He wasn't mad and didn't seem to have an attitude. Granted he wanted a shake and they couldn't do that because they were closing in 10 minutes, but he didn't get cranky with her and her eye rolling and confrontational attitude was too much for the situation, almost like she was trying to get a rise out of him and goad him. We spent 6 hours traveling and were tired and achy from the flights and walking and just wanted to get to our room to eat and go to bed. Avoid the baked potatoe, it looks like the potatoes and most of the food is prepared way in advance.   Nothing is fresh .  The potato shouldn't be brown on the inside ... Not very good food. Only had breakfast. Great service though. The waitress was helpful in navigating what was what on the menu. Too much butter on everything. The whole breakfast just tasted like butter and salt from the meat. It seems to be food that's just heated up and put together. I've used the \"hash browns\" that are just potatoes O'Brien at home before from the frozen aisle at the grocery store. The eggs are fresh though but still have that strong butter taste."

Extra toppings are $.90  On a nice day, you can sit outside on the patio & enjoy  the pretty views. What a sham! This is a $25 pepperoni pizza I just picked up. Good to know I'm save my money for next time by avoiding this place. It says \u201cNew York Style Pizza\u201d on the window. Now,  I\u2019m not from New York, but been there many times. Speaking for myself and I\u2019m sure New Yorkers would agree as well that this is definitely New York style. I was in town for work and a sales rep treated us with pizza from this place. It was so good, I came on my own the next day and got myself an 18\u2019 pizza\nService was great, the place was clean and food was fresh. Got back to my hotel and went to work on this thing lol\nI mean look at the size of my slice!\nMoney well spent! I\u2019m so disgusted I\u2019ve eaten here for while and for my first time ordering salad it came with dirt all over it. The man in the phone couldn\u2019t even do a refund or send out a new salad. So now I have to wait until tomorrow to get a refund for  my salad that is covered in dirt and has holes like the Lettuce is old. The salad also had mostly lettuce and nothing else.\n\nI went back and got a delicious salad on the house they were extremely nice and the salad was so delicious. I will be returning the service was great and I fell in love with salad and I am still craving it this was a great comeback thank you. Good pizza, good service, clean interior. Some outdoor seating. Walk to the counter to place your order: type of crust, sauce, toppings, and if you want a drink. Inexpensive, seating at the bar (approximately 6 seats), or at a table or booth in the small seating area. Staff very helpful with my food allergies, advised according, thanks. Simple, decent, relaxing."

The Challah French Toast was very good with thick slices of bread that stood up well to the process, fresh strawberries and blueberries and real maple syrup. The cappuccino was average at best. Next time, I'll go for drip coffee. There was a small selection of pastries that looked very good.\n\nService was prompt and friendly. The woman that took my order at the counter went through the menu to explain what they had. The space was bright and pleasant with both booths and tables. They do have unsecured Wi-Fi for customers.\n\nThere is limited on street parking in front of the cafe and more parking in lots behind the shops on either side of the street. I\u2019ve always enjoyed getting their bread at various grocery stores - forgot they had a cafe/bakery! How do they not have at least a 4.4/4.5 on here? Food was fresh, above average quality, really balanced flavors (on the sandwich I got), bread was obviously good, and the person taking orders at the counter was extremely friendly! Great fast-casual restaurant! If you\u2019re looking for a good cafe style sandwich, this is a great place -\n\nTakeout was super convenient & on time, thanks everyone! Will Definitely be back! I was happy with the Paleo bowl, perfect quick, healthier breakfast option than other fast food places. Small inside but cozy. Not too expensive The owners are very greedy! When they come in to eat they use employees earned tip money to pay for their food so they dont have to pay but the restaurant still gets money! Not to mention there was a harassment compliment about one of the managers there and well instead of firing the manager they told said manager about the complaint so that he could continue to treat said employee horribly. Just so unethical! Just wanted people to know what type of company this is. The food it good! Just horrible greedy unethical ownership. DO BETTER Lovely dining spot for fresh tasty food! I recommend any of the rotating soups or the Justin bowl. All of the juice blends are amazing but The Detox is by far my favorite."

    "reviews": "Omg!! What have I discovered?!  A staple to the Central Park neighborhood this old flight tower (CP\u2019s airport \u2708\ufe0f).\n\nThis is how this has to be one of the most fun, entertaining game, oriented, places with the largest patio in ALL of Denver.\n\nFirst of all, it\u2019s massive. There are many floors in the first and third floor for food and drinks \ud83e\udd64. The first floor has bowling and an arcade and an outdoor mini golf center outside great outdoor receiving huge patio lots of different kinds of seating.\n\nThe third floor has amazing views all around a bar & and goes up to the tower. No one at the door to explain this place but a great bartender hooked me up on details at the bar. Good atmosphere for multi generational groups. Quiet Thursday afternoon but I bet weekend are fun! Lots of games inside and outside.  Dog friendly.  If you want to go up in the tower you have to pay and it's 11 floors you have to climb no elevator. The spot is awesome in general but the TOUR of the tower was AMAZING!!!! If you like history, especially Colorado history, you MUST go do the tour. Sean was our guide and he is so knowledgeable and made it so fun. The photos of the location (the old airport) before it all moved to DIA are so dang cool!! & the view at the top is unbelievable. Sean even made labels for what you\u2019re seeing in the distance. I seriously could not recommend this place enough (dinner afterward was fantastic and the vibe is great). But the tour was *chef\u2019s kiss*. You have to do that first. I demand it. What a VIBE \u2728 First time to Denver/Boulder area and this is the best place in this area (dare I say, better than Red Rock Amphitheater!!). Everyone must check out the Tower Tower \u2014 the history of the former Denver Intl Airport was amazing (Sean is one of the best tour guides & historian I\u2019ve listened to!). There\u2019s something surreal about having a casual beer in the control tower with views of downtown Denver, Boulder, the neighborhoods & realizing they used to watch planes land here. And after the tour, you can check out their mini golf course; volleyball court; bowling alley; arcade; wall scrabble; everything in between.\n\nThe tour is a walk of 13 flights but Sean does an amazing job with breaking it up with historical pictures on the walls that the walk down feels longer than the walk up! There are chairs throughout, if needed & I can\u2019t wait to visit Denver again to check out the progress of this place. People need to check this tour out & keep coming because my brother who lives here learns something new every time. Free small beer included with the tour too! Flyteco tower is our favorite local spot to grab food and a beer. They now are offering consistent tours to the top of the old air traffic control tower and it is a must-see for locals and visitors alike!! We\u2019ve climbed to the top a few times now, and each time we learn more about the history of the old Stapleton airport and Denver history in general. The tour guide and owners of the brewery truly care about the customer experience and it shows!!\n\nIf you can, I highly recommend going on a sunrise tour to the top of the tower- it is hands down the best sunrise view you can get here in Denver and the glow on the mountains and the skyline are just fabulous."

That's all that needs to be said. Great food and service. The lengua tacos were incredible and the pastor is amazing. The cashier threw in a free taco when I told him I was visiting Denver for the first time. Coming from Southern California this is as close to authentic as you can get. I'd give more than 5 stars if I could. We ordered tacos del vapor and the lady misunderstood and placed the order for tacos Al pastor, didn\u2019t bother to repeat the order back to us. When we told them we didn\u2019t order those tacos the owner rudely accused us of being in the wrong and made us pay for the other tacos they incorrectly made on top of the other tacos."

Very nice people that work here I'm not sure why, but the man with the glasses is incredibly rude. I'm not sure why he took issue with me, but I tried them out about three times, and each time, he treated me poorly. I was always respectful and always left a tip but decided to stop coming somewhere where I'm not wanted.\n\nThe food is okay. I found the meat very fatty, and service is incredibly slow (30+ minute wait for take out). I was missing Mexico (where I was raised) and looked for something reminiscent. This isn't it. Best quesadilla I\u2019ve ever had. Do yourself a favor and get a chicharron quesadilla. Only half pictured.\n\nNot pictured but equally delicious were the asada tacos and huarache. They were not pictured because i ate them so fast.\n\nI will be visiting again next time I am in Denver area and will hopefully get a chance to try the desserts as they looked great as well. Came in and got the Barbacoa, did not walk away disappointed. It was extremely good as were the tortillas & consome with generous servings and reasonable prices. Great!"

It\u2019s not a Dunkin restaurant attached to a gas station like they usually are or how Dunkins are always attached to Baskin Robins. It\u2019s just Dunkin containers in the middle of the convenient store where you fill the cup yourself. It\u2019s also not good, poorly maintained, isn\u2019t served, so you can\u2019t have your coffee the way you\u2019d expect Dunkin to make it. Not a real Dunking store, just Dunkin coffee in a Travel Stop Gas Station.  Surprised Dunkin let's them use their  name. Also, the google search needs to be updated to indicate its not a Dunking,  just a Dunking coffee bar in a gas station. Does not say on Google Maps that this is an Express DD. We drove all the way here expecting to find a Dunkin Donuts Drive through only for there to be no coffee and no service. Very frustrating. Not a dunkin donuts store. Just a small section in the store with self serve coffee I was expecting a stand alone Dunkin' facility.  It is a self-serve gas station style coffee bar that serves Dunkin' coffee.  No donuts, no breakfast.  I also could not use my Dunkin' app to pay for my drink.  I do not recommend this location."

    "reviews": "First, the service was great!!! The guy at the counter was super friendly and cheerful in an inviting way.  The restaurant was laid out well and I felt I had privacy so I also appreciated that.  I wanted lunch but I was too early so I decided to try the English Muffin sandwich.  It was so so.  The muffin was stale I think and cracked as I was eating the sandwich.  The potatoes that go with breakfast are yummy!  No joke.  The seasoning far surpassed what I expect for fast food but Wendy's has always made good potato products.  Best fries of any fast food.  I would stop there again but hopefully at lunch time. Well, this Wendy's seems to still keep their fountain machines working and their front cash registers employed with actual people, so there is a start.\n\nShame the crew there had a bit of trouble getting every order in-line to be churned put, but that manager on duty was doing his damnedest to make sure it was happening. A lot of DoorDash nonsense, people can get out and eat again!\n\nFood was alright, tho. Doesn't help half our food sat on the trays in the back for longer than they should have. If you have somewhere to be do not stop here. I sat in the drive thru for 15 minutes for fries when I asked for my refund because it was ridiculous I was told \u201cour fries are down there\u2019s nothing I can do about it\u201d how about telling your customers that before taking their money and not having the product? Or after realizing the mistake coming to the window not sitting there walking back and forth until I say something. Made me late to work and I didn\u2019t get food. 0/5 Kimberley was the cashier, did an amazing job. Food was hot and fresh. Not to busy, drive through is little more traffic. Good and fresh made coffee. Restroom was very clean and smells good. Thanks"

We have eaten here a few times and are never disappointed. The Chalet is a classic. It\u2019s one of those old-school diners where you always know what you\u2019re getting\u2014solid food, fast service, and a relaxed, no-frills vibe. The menu\u2019s huge, breakfast is served all day, and the portions are generous without being over the top.\n\nThe staff is friendly and efficient, even when it\u2019s busy. It\u2019s the kind of place where they remember you if you come in more than once. Whether you\u2019re stopping in for pancakes, a burger, or just a cup of coffee, The Chalet is always a dependable, delicious choice. Great place! I had the Customers Favorite. \"Mess\" something. I forgot the name but it was a biscuits and gravy with potatoes bacon. It was delicious! There was a lady. I forgot her name. She's Hispanic and has amazing customer service. Felt very welcomed and left better than satisfied. It's simply a great, very old mom and pop restaurant.  The deco has never  been updated. That's what helps  give it its charm. You will see older adults, quite conversations taking place.  I just love this peaceful little restaurant. Service is fast, very friendly and the food was good.\n\nHad the patty melt, meat was cooked perfectly with a good flavor, caramelized onion and fully melted cheese.   Bread was just okay.  Had a salad on the side, iceberg lettuce with plenty of options for salad dressing."

    "reviews": "I\u2019ve been to several Brazilian restaurants in the U.S. and Europe, and I can confidently say this is the best one I\u2019ve ever been to outside of Brazil\u2014hands down the best in Denver!\n\nThe decor is beautiful, the location is great, and the service was absolutely perfect. Our waitress was beyond amazing\u2014super friendly, chatted with us about Brazil, and made us feel at home.\n\nThe food was incredible! The seasoning was authentically Brazilian, bringing back so many memories of home. The ingredients seemed top-notch, and the dishes were not only delicious but also well-prepared and beautifully presented.\n\nFor Denver, the prices are totally reasonable, and honestly, this place is worth every penny. After the meal, they even offered a Brazilian-style coffee, which was a perfect touch to wrap up the experience.\n\nOn top of that, they have a little market full of Brazilian goodies you can take home!\n\nYou can go without hesitation! I\u2019m already planning to come back at night to enjoy the live music and have an ice-cold beer. Can\u2019t wait! Several friends and I celebrated a birthday at Little Brazil and had a fantastic time! Many of us ordered the Picanha a la 5280, and the steak was flavorful and tender. The beef-filled sous vide onion was delectable! We also enjoyed the Brazilian Cheese Bread and the Hora da Festa, a bite-sized croquette sampler. Each croquette was uniquely delicious and left us wanting more!\n\nAs a non-drinker, I appreciated the robust selection of interesting and well-thought-out mocktails made with non-alcoholic spirits.\n\nLastly, the service was impeccable! Our large party felt welcome and well-accommodated, and our server was genuinely delightful.\n\nI encourage everyone to support this fantastic local restaurant. We are fortunate to have it right here in Wheat Ridge! Well appointed menu with all of the Brazilian favorites you would expect.\nThe service was great and the chef/manager came to our table to answer some questions we had. Because we have spent a lot of time in Brazil, we were curious to know more about his background.\n\nThe presentation is some of the best we have ever seen and they even offer chicken hearts (which can be hard to find).\n\nCute atmosphere but parking can be tough.\n\n\ud83d\udcf8 Click on the photos to see what we ordered. An Absolute Gem\u2014A Must for Food Lovers!\n\nLittle Brazil in Wheat Ridge is a true dining experience, not just a meal. From the moment you step inside, you're welcomed by an elegant yet inviting atmosphere\u2014a modern coffee bar, a full bar, an expansive dining space wrapped in floor-to-ceiling windows, and even a charming market stocked with imported Brazilian treats and handmade take-home meals.\n\nThe staff? Impeccable. Friendly, polished, and working like a well-rehearsed team, ensuring every detail is just right. One of the owners was on hand, not just supervising but actively engaging with customers and staff\u2014true hospitality in action.\n\nNow, the food\u2014comfort food at its finest, prepared with simplicity, freshness, and heart. Every bite transports you straight to Brazil. The ambiance is warm, the seating is comfortable (no plastic tables here!), and the experience is elevated by live Brazilian music\u2014upbeat, refreshing, and absolutely delightful.\n\nPerfect for date night, a gathering with friends, or a fun family evening. If you call yourself a foodie and haven't been here yet, it's time to fix that. Little Brazil is a must-visit! #LiveRemarkably We sat at the bar on a busy Friday night (during Restaurant Week \ud83d\ude2c) and the food, drinks and service were all amazing! We should've skipped the sample platter appetizer because the entrees (steak, stroganoff and salmon) were huge portions!\n\nThanks to the staff for the great service.\n\nLoved the all gender bathrooms."

Oh and the drinks!! Enjoy your time with friends and family on the front patio!! Bellissimo!! Great service and great food. Unique tales on comfort food. The Shepards pie was so good. It was like French onion soup meets shepards pie. I stopped by for a quick meal and was surprised with the live Irish music. Might have been open mic night. Violin, fiddle, hand drum and dulcimer were great musicians.\nBurger and cold beer are very good. A group of 10 of us came and our service was great. We asked for separate checks and the server didn't even flinch! She took great care of us! She got our to go boxes, and dessert to go! The Shepards pie was heavy on mushrooms this time, which I, personally don't care for."

    "reviews": "Wanted to find somewhere to eat outdoors. Found this place and was super happy we did. Got the Brussel sprouts, wedge salad (not pictured), and buffalo chicken wrap. The Brussel sprouts were cooked to perfection. I love it crispy. And the wrap was delicious. Our server was so friendly and attentive. Seating was great with lot of outdoor options. We will be back! I helped set up a friend's baby shower here recently. The upstairs space was well thought out and had a cool pass-through window from the bar to both sides of the space. They even have gluten free and dairy free options for their burger. They have CO beers and cider on tap, and it's reasonably priced. Everyone who helped with our event from servers to bartenders were all super nice and I would definitely consider coming here for more gatherings. There's a beautiful view from the top floor event space, too. It has a cool tavern atmosphere. Anyway, you should go there. I visited Colorado Plus Brew Pub and Taphouse and thought it was a nice place to enjoy a brew. However, I didn't look carefully at the beer menu and discovered that many of their beers are actually brewed by other brew houses. I'll definitely go back to try one of their beers. This place has so much potential. This is my second time here and the food is good nothing out of this world. But I find it annoying when you go to a burger place and it doesn't just come with fries. Also thr place is so big and always empty. If the place had more people the atmosphere would be amazing! Probably overdue for a review. I've been going to CO Plus for a long time. Not quite since day one, but pretty close. They've had their ups and downs, and just like some other folks have pointed out, I liked it the way it used to be. I also realize running a restaurant/brewpub isn't easy. Change is sometimes necessary. They're doing their best to adapt. The new setup is growing on me. We're looking forward to warmer weather and that new patio. The event space upstairs is great. I even tried something new tonight. The KoAm Smash burger was on point. Chips with ranch, good as ever. Smaller selection of beer, but still solid. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend CO Plus to friends, family or coworkers."

Will go back and try some more items and the beer. Nice baby changing station . Delicious tacos and refreshing, tasty beer! They have a nice lunch deal of 2 tacos + a beer for $15! Staff were so friendly, welcoming and helpful. We were visiting from out of town and this was the perfect place to land for lunch. You really can\u2019t get better, a brewery with tacos! Give it a try and keep dreaming of the tacos all week like us! Fantastic drinks and quality food. I had the torta and the bread was so fresh and delicious it went perfect with my paloma. Great concept of turning an old auto oil change shop to a restaurant and brewery. Not bad but I wanted the nice, messy looking quesabirria from the photos, but alas. I got the clean ones. See photo. Also the beer wasn\u2019t ice cold. Spent $50+ on lunch for two. This is our 3rd time being here, and we absolutely love it. My husband is hispanic, and authentic Mexican food is very hard to find. And this place has mastered authenticity and flavor! Our two favorite beers here, Mestizo and Oaxaquena, are so packed full of the perfect flavors. Not too sweet or bitter. Just perfect. They know how to make amazing food and drinks. This is our new favorite restaurant!"

Portions are generous and delicious. La Fonda is a great place do grab a quick meal or celebrate an anniversary or birthday with family and friends. The menu is huge and many delicious options are available to choose from with reasonable pricing. This is a very good place to eat! Impressive old style mexican restaurant. The service was quick and friendly, and most importantly the food was really good. This restaurant was amazing! Met a friend for a later lunch. It was not busy at all. (But to should be). The service was fast and friendly. I ordered the Vegetarian Burrito. This burrito can easily be made vegan if you ask for no cheese or sour cream. It was really delicious. My friend got a chicken enchilada and beef taco and said it was excellent. Highly reccomend this spot for lunch and dinner. I generally like their food but lately the portions seem to be shrinking with the prices going up.  Whatever you do don\u2019t order a chili relleno, especially if you are hungry. It\u2019s the smallest I\u2019ve ever seen. I grow larger green chilies in my garden. Sad. Green chili was awesome, so were the enchiladas, burrito, tamale, tacos, and chips and salsa. Really reasonable prices and great Cinco De Mayo drink specials. Friendly staff, large portions, and quick service!"

The cheese pull was unmatched. The pizzas were all good as well My husband and I got takeout from here the other day and shared:\n\n- Crispy Pork Sandwich with Pasta Salad\n- BYO Detroit Style Pizza with Pineapple, Pepperoni, and Caramelized Onions\n\nEverything was phenomenal. I'm always hesitant to order sandwiches for takeout but this one was still so good. The pizza had the crispy cheese crust that was done perfectly.\n\nI'd love to dine in because I'm sure it's even better. Sourdough crust and a great beer selection. Went for a business dinner, sat out side at the large patio. Beer selection was 15 deep on tap and another 20 in cans and bottles. They have pitchers down to tasters.\nThe pizza was phenomenal, choice of either New York Style with a small (12\" and large 15\") and Detroit Style (8x8 cut into 4 squares) toppings are 1.13 per and they have some good ones. Brisket, ham hock, artichokes and quite a bit more.\nWe also had the cheese bread app. This was 6 pieces with an gooey center of cheese and butter.\nI heard they have doughnuts from spare dough but they only have them until they run out. We were not lucky.\nPatio had live music and the staff was really friendly and just happy that the table is happy.\nParking is mostly on the street which can get very busy and hard to find. Good Detroit style pizza and beer. Wasn\u2019t a huge fan of the Carolina style wings as they had honey mustard sauce on them. Also be mindful of the 4% service charge automatically added on to your bill. The service was quick and efficient, and location was great right on Tennyson St. I\u2019ll return to try the NY style pizza and some different wings."

I wish the lamb kabobs had more flavor.\n\nI did really like the baba ghanoush and labneh with the bread. Ordered the sampler platter and beets as appetizers to share between 4 people, gyro platter for myself, salmon plate for a friend, and lamb tagine for a friend. Sampler platter had hummus, baba ghanoush, yogurt dip, cheese wrapped in grape leaves and pita bread. The pita bread was soft and fluffy. The dips were really tasty especially the yogurt based one. It was sweeter than expected which was a nice surprise. The gyro platter is large and can be shared between two people. It was good but nothing exciting. The salmon dish was seasoned well but a little too charred. The lamb tagine is super rich in flavor so would have been good for sharing. The service was not great - server was a little too slow in returning back to us whenever we needed more water or to order. Would be skipping this place when looking for a dine-in date experience. This place was fantastic! The food was fresh and tasty and well seasoned. It came out quickly too! Very impressed! We will be back. Oh and the Maple Old Fashioned was excellent! This Mediterranean restaurant is one of my favorites! We had the chicken shawarma sandwich, which came with crispy, delicious fries, ketchup, and a creamy garlic sauce. The gyro plate was also fantastic, served on creamy hummus with a side of pita for dipping. The cozy and inviting interior adds to the experience, and the service has always been excellent. The front of the restaurant has a beautifully naturally lit space for customers. We went for lunch and enjoyed our meal! The falafel was more beautiful and moist than I\u2019ve ever had before. It was a gorgeous shade of green on the inside. I\u2019m not even someone who likes falafel usually.\n\nThe dips and seasoned olives were delicious! Be sure to at least sample them."

Overall great appetizers, except for the corn which needed (wonton?) chips of something to eat with it. We had to grab our own utensils from other tables but service was otherwise good. What a wonderful experience! The food and service were exceptional. I ordered a Tofu Fried Rice and had the perfect complement for the afternoon, with their awesome NA beer offering: Rationale Hazy IPA. The portions were very generous and you can tell that the food is made with love. Can\u2019t wait to come back! My wife and I were in the area to visit the Denver Cat Co later in the day and decided to have dinner in the Tennyson street area.  After looking for options online, we were walking to the place we had decided on when we passed the Funky Buddha.  It had a welcoming ambience that spilled out onto the sidewalk.  After checking out the menu, we became intrigued and decided to give it a try.  It was absolutely wonderful from the atmosphere to the food, drinks and pricing.  They had both indoor and outdoor dining options.  The draft beer selection was quite impressive and the food was delicious.  The service was also excellent!  We don't live in the area, but I feel like we'll be making special trips back in the future. A great restaurant with a huge variety of delicious Asian foods. The vibes are great. They have very cool artwork and play a lot of chill beats. The pork skewers are fatty, juicy, and delicious. The Nasi Lemak was authentic and very spicy. The coconut rice was amazing! There is an extensive bar too. You should know, they charge a 3% hidden fee for credit cards.

Now let's get to it!!!!!!!!!!!!\n\nTHE WINGS\n1. 6 Sweet bbq wings were delicious, small  party wings but delicious.\n\n2. The dry rub was okay, not my style, but the table still ate them.\n\n3. The peanut butter sauce was so good I had to buy a jar of it!!!!!!!! I've never experienced wings in that capacity.\n\n4. If you're thirsty, grab the Lemonade spritz drink. It'll hit that spot she said I did, lol.\n\n5. The crispy treats that I've attached to this review is the BOMB.COM, I'm a huge Captain Crunch fan, so I had to throw down.\n\n6. Last but not least, the atmosphere hit hard, including my server, Reid. Will definitely return. Honestly some of the best wings I\u2019ve ever had! Even though the wings are smaller (because they use chicken w/o steroids), it\u2019s worth it because of the flavor! I got the \u201cEl Jefe\u201d & \u201cCilantro Lime\u201d flavors for the sauces and wow they were absolutely delicious! Beware the El Jefe flavor is SPICY!!! It\u2019s made with capsaicin so it\u2019s really spicy even for spice lovers like myself, but I\u2019d eat it all over again. Highly recommend to come here on Tuesday for some good wing deals (and $7 burgers!), but there\u2019s deals every day of the week too. One of my favorite wing spots in Colorado. Lots of options for sauces with different heat ratings. I always come for the Extra hot and El Jefe, which both are very spicy and well made. Their rasberry habenero is a must try as well. Not crazy hot but different from the normal mango habenero that most other places carry. They serve local beers on tap and have a good selection of other drinks. The bar is small and indoor seating is comfy. Outdoor covered seating offers more tables. They have weekly specials on drinks and Happy hour is Mon-Friday 3-6p.m. I highly recommend coming in, again, the wings are bomb! May be the tiniest wings I\u2019ve ever seen. I\u2019d bet you could have fit all 9 on a single dollar bill. Notice how they\u2019re the same size as a tot. Must be taking out baby chickens. Same for my Brothers who also ate with me. The Caribbean jerk sauce (green) was awful but the others we had were decent. If you couldn\u2019t tell by the photo, this places food was DELICIOUS! My family wasted no time to dig in and eat every last bit we could! Their cheeseburgers are very good and made me feel satisfied. Their mozzarella wheels, however, look much better than they taste. They don\u2019t taste bad, and were definitely good, but they look much more flavorful. The fries were really good too!"

    "reviews": "The service was absolutely amazing. We came to the restaurant at lunch for a birthday and the service was exceptional. Andrew was our server and was friendly, attentive and made us feel like friends. This is our new favorite spot and we will be returning. Thank you to Andrew and Sushi Hai! I\u2019ve been meaning to try Sushi Hai for a long time. My son\u2019s birthday and his love of sushi made it a good opportunity to see what I\u2019ve been missing.\n\nWe made reservations for 6:30 on a Saturday night. It was just early enough that we didn\u2019t have to wait to be seated. Unfortunately, we were seated right by the door and the typical noise and commotion of patrons coming and going. They happily moved us to another table that was not bad. It too was in the front of the house and subject to a lot of noise and traffic with people headed to the back of the restaurant which looked to be more nicely appointed and quieter. I suggest asking to be seated in that area if you are looking for a quiet meal.\n\nThe service was good. Our server was attentive and patient as we took our time to determine what we wanted. We ordered edamame and calamari as appetizers and both were excellent. Then we moved on to entrees and a sushi selection. All were nicely presented and good eating. I had the crispy salmon while others enjoyed lamb chops and a variety of nigiri sushi. There were no complaints.\n\nOverall it was good food and service. The four star vs five star is a function of the noise and traffic at the front of the house. Our server Lulu made our first experience one to remember! She was very welcoming, patiently answered our questions and made great recommendations. Our dishes were prepared beautifully, and the chefs went above and beyond to accommodate us by preparing a small dish of nicely cut strawberries for my daughter. Everyone was very professional. The atmosphere is clean, inviting, and super unique! We were so surprised to find out there were multiple levels to the building and Lulu invited us all to come back for comedy downstairs on Thursdays or to dine in a private seating area with a group of 6 or more. She informed us about the possibility of hosting private events there as well, and a heads up that New Years and Valentine\u2019s Day get pretty packed so to plan ahead! We cannot wait to go back with friends and family! I love this place. Great quality sushi, atmosphere snd service, always. Their lobster roll is phenomenal, must get it! Hillary was our server most recently and she took great care of us. My dining experience at Sushi Hai was amazing. The atmosphere was inviting, and the staff was incredibly friendly, especially my server, Anthony. The chefs behind the bar were equally delightful, sitting at the bar was a highlight, which was a nice up-close view of the sushi preparation. I wholeheartedly recommend Sushi Hai \u2013 a solid 10/10!"

He asked about different flavors I enjoy and was able to customize a flight with some really interesting flavors. These ciders are very unique, interesting and delicious! I highly recommend stopping in and trying a flight! Some of the best cider I've ever had. Flights offered, friendly bartender, fun selection of European (German & Swiss..?) food. We had a pretzel with the cider cheese-- hit the spot! OK the bartenders were absolutely amazing and on spot. Definitely very personable. Totally cute atmosphere plenty of parking about everywhere. Everybody in the entire place. No matter what table you were at was all still talking to each other. Totally amazing. Maybe it was just the timing but I\u2019m saying worth a go. Service was great, facility was clean and cute. Cider donuts, delicious. The chicken chorizo burritos and the bacon burritos were both great, but even better with the salsa. The iced honey lavender latte was light and refreshing, and I absolutely loved how warm and authentically spicy the chai was!\nCan't want to be back to try the cider side! Awesome! This place has cool vibes and great food. The staff made us feel welcomed and like we were a member of the family. We'll definitely be back."

    "reviews": "First stop on the Pub Pass journey. Must say great first stop. We spent an easy 6 hours here, drinking beers, playing games, and enjoying each other company. There is a lot of outdoor seating and indoors. We took over a small room which needed no reservations. Even though it was busy, the bartenders were quick to help with service. A lot of parties took place when we were there and parts of the brewery was cordon off but didn\u2019t stop us from enjoying our time. The live music which at first thought it was the radio from the speakers to the surprise when going out side it was an actually person singing. Definitely would go back again. All the staff were super friendly. The food was a bit pricey for the amount but flavor was pretty good. We ordered the Mac n cheese and 2 types of pizza to share. The atmosphere was fun and dog friendly! Wow, how cool is this? It has this huge screen outside covered area tons of seating, unique places to order your stuff from plenty of bartenders all working had a DJ big screens on the inside to watch the sports games. Also great drink specials the bathrooms were super unique and clean. Parking was a little bit difficult but that\u2019s the biggest struggle. Very unique I would definitely say try it out. This place is awesome. Number 38 continues to be my favorite spot in Denver\u2014and my dog\u2019s too! Whether it\u2019s catching a big game, biking there on a sunny Saturday, or just swinging by for happy hour, it never disappoints. The food and service are always top-notch. The concept is truly one-of-a-kind\u2014an awesome blend of bar, event space, and sunny outdoor venue which you won\u2019t find anywhere else. A must-visit destination in Denver and truly unique concept!! This place is one of a kind. I\u2019ve never been able to feel so comfortable, imbibed, and inspired. The views and music alone make it worth the trip but the staff and food are cherries on top. If you\u2019re in Denver - check this joint out."

    "reviews": "Went here on a Monday evening. It was not too crowded and the bartender there was super cool. He made sure everyone was taken care of. The drinks that were made are super delicious and tasted right. It was drink betting day, so we were able to play heads or tails to get free drinks. Luckily I was able to win the game and got my drinks for free. This place does really cool events. I recommend to check this place out and I will definitely be coming back if I\u2019m ever in the area again. I can't recommend River Bar enough! It perfectly captures that hometown feel, making it one of the most welcoming bars in Denver. You can tell the owner has poured her heart into creating a truly special place. And don\u2019t miss out on the pickle shots\u2014they\u2019re hands down the best in Denver! Popped in for a drink during Happy Hour and wasn\u2019t disappointed. Their happy hour specials were unreal with lots of tasty $1 options. Vibe was a mix of dive-y and artsy. Service was great. Perfect spot to hideaway and enjoy a drink with great company. Super cheap drinks, power hour from 6-7pm they have $1 shots, domestic beers, and lemon drop martinis definitely worth going to! Plus a cool atmosphere with shuffle board and pool. 10/10 This is a nice small neighborhood bar, that does put on various events that can draw crowds. While its small compared to others  this adds to the quaint feel I enjoy.\n\nThe bar tenders are awesome and friendly."

    "reviews": "Great divey bar feel to it. The Dewey sour was good on tap, but again it was more sour side rather than a heavily fruited sour or smoothie style was looking for in town anywhere. Real dog friendly, shout out to lil sweet Scarlet chillin regular dog I recently visited Dewey Beer Colorado and ordered a brew. Unfortunately, the barrel ran out before my glass was full, and the beertender didn't change the barrel and fill my glass as promised. I paid for a full glass, so it was disappointing to not get what I paid for. It's hard to give a good review when small things like this happen. Great beers! Lagers, sours, IPAs, stouts. Friendly staff, nice space. Family friendly. a Great patio. Will make sure to keep this one in the rotation every time I\u2019m in town. Great Brewery with a lot of character and unique charm. Their selection of brews are so delicious and varied. Also, they are very reasonably priced.\n\nWill definitely go back again! Not a lot of interior seating but very cozy atmosphere Refused to take the 2025 Denver Pub Pass and provided very rude and poor customer service after asking if they accepted it. Instead of trying to provide solutions, we were greeted with, \"oh, no, we won't be accepting that. We don't do beer.\" immediately, instead of trying to provide other solutions and with a beer menu of 20+ beers. Interesting. You've officially lost any potential for business from us and others we've encountered this exact same situation and experience with the pub pass. It would've been fine if the customer service was different or even if they could've provided a different solution despite not \"accepting\" the pub pass anymore, the poor & rude customer service completely turned me off from ever supporting this business. If I could've left no stars or negative stars, I 100% would."

    "reviews": "Snooze, an AM Eatery, is a lively and welcoming breakfast spot. The atmosphere is inviting, with a friendly and patient staff that handles even large groups with ease\u2014great for gatherings or a casual solo breakfast.\n\nMenu has the plenty of options to choose from and the ability to customize your breakfast to suit your taste. A must-try dish is the Eggs Benedict, which not only tastes great but is also beautifully presented. If you\u2019re looking for a little extra boost, their morning cocktails are a refreshing way to start the day.\n\nThe entrance faces northwest, and the facility is wheelchair accessible, ensuring a comfortable visit for everyone. Service is attentive and patient, even when managing large groups.\n\nOverall, I recommend this place. I\u2019ll definitely return for another great meal! Landed in in Denver and we were hungry our Airbnb host recommended this place. We made our way down. Had a great breakfast great service. The hostess was very friendly very welcoming. We sat outside with our dog. It was dog friendly. Our weight person was fantastic. I like the menu, the food was good servings and portions were great all in all very good place. Highly recommend. A warm and inviting atmosphere with outstanding service (special thanks to Allie). The menu offers a fantastic variety of top-notch options. The Bloody Mary is simply excellent. The coffee was brewed to perfection. This place did not disappoint!!  If anything, I wish I could have ordered more:) we went with the Snooze 3 egg classic with their over-the-top bacon and the egg white veggie scramble, adding chorizo. The chorizo gave it a little kick - absolutely delicious! Hash browns on the side and an oat milk latte\u2026 but there is a lot to choose from. This location is the original (18 years!! That should tell you all you need to know!) and it has this cool retro vibe, amazing service.\n\nWhen we arrived it was easy to get a seat, but as we were leaving it around 10:30 am it was getting packed! Totally worth going.. a couple of times! This place is spectacular. I\u2019m sad that I didn\u2019t discover it sooner on my short first trip here. I had the crab and asparagus omelette, which was incredible. I also enjoyed the Abso-bacon-lutely and it was also perfect. The drinks were expertly made (latte and the mocktails). The service was amazing and friendly. I\u2019ll definitely return and recommend to everyone."

    "reviews": "Was on the hunt for good gluten-free pizza and this is the best one I have found. Tried the Williamsburg and the Pistachio, both here very flavorful and the crust was delicious. My friend who is not gluten-free could not tell the difference. Also tried the Spinach Artichoke dip with gluten-free focaccia which was good. Went at lunch hour and it was pretty empty but service was a bit slow but not terrible, only one waitress. Would definitely recommend if you are gluten-free, lots of options that they execute well. The pizza was good, reasonably priced.  Our expectations were high after seeing them on the Michelin guide, but its just a nice wood fired pizza joint. This is a staple stop for me here in Denver, their pizza is always fresh and delicious. Outdoor dog friendly seating. Good location with a small but usually space available parking lot Nextdoor. Truly some of the best gluten free pizza I\u2019ve ever tried. We got the spinach and artichoke dip with gf focaccia, eggplant rollatini and the vodka sauce pie with pancetta. I got a vegan Queens pizza, it was tasty but very little toppings for $18. My friends got the regular ones and their toppings were more generous.\nService was not good."

    "reviews": "Love grabbing a beer here but finally came for brunch when I saw they have a honey butter chicken biscuit. Unfortunately it\u2019s the worst I\u2019ve ever had and had no redeeming qualities but i was hungover so I ate it. Biscuit was super doughy and not flaky, definitely either old or low quality frozen or something. Oddly had a vanilla taste to it. Not what I would expect out of a biscuit.\n\nAs usual for Denver restaurants (except for fast food restaurants\u2026) the chicken wasn\u2019t brined before it was fried so it was nearly flavorless. Any honey that got put on there didn\u2019t make it to my tastebuds. Overall wack HBCB.\n\nOn the bright side the Firestone Walker Blood Orange Cali Squeeze was gas and I got to sit and watch some hockey for a bit. Definitely never coming here again for food though after that introduction to their kitchen. Loved the service and great food!  Fun place to come with friends.  They even have space for private parties!! This place looks closed from the outside. Not a great place but they have a good beer selection and lots of seating. The bartenders are ok and the place is clean. I would come back to this place. I didn't try the food so maybe I'll go back to try the food. The green chili was great, and the beer prices were pretty good. We went on a gross rainy night for pub food and good beer before a concert. Lots of beer choices, excellent vibe, and food was decent. Being from Rochester, NY, the wings weren\u2019t 5 star but were good and sauce tasty. The outdoor area would be sweet in better weather and was walkable to Mission Ballroom."

    "reviews": "Wing Wednesday was a bust. There are only three options to chose from and only one option at a time. Wings are served with a side of mayonnaise--and ranch is $1 for a 2 ounce cup. The ranch was served warm and we returned it.\nUltimately, not worth the $68 dollars we spent on one round of greasy wings and two drinks.\nThe wings were crunchy and covered in sauce, but lacked any specific flavors or notable tastes.\nService was fair, but the waitress was transactional and not very friendly.\nUltimately, it comes as a good deal on paper but the serving size was much to large to try any other flavor. Bummer! 2nd review\u2014 So, I usually go to BrewDog for their wings. This time we visited for the taco Tuesday happy hour. 4 tacos & 1 Margarita. I signed the bill at $24 or so and was charged for $81.67. I tried resolving the issue with Elliot and another person, but they\u2019re not calling me back to follow up when they said they would. Which has left me extremely unimpressed. Clearly they don\u2019t care about resolving the issue. I had to file a fraud claim and my bank will be in touch with them. Important takeaway? Keep your receipt!!!\n\n1st review\u2014\nThe wings at Brew Dog are simply amazing. Meaty, tender. The buffalo sauce is different. Sweet I think. The beer selection is great and sours on tap are so good. Can\u2019t wait to come back!!! While the food is great, it's probably twice the cost as it was precovid. Small tacos for $6 each. They were good. But no longer inexpensive. But that seems to be most places these days.\nNice selection of beer, especially their selection of home brewed beer that's not just all IPAs.\nThis has been the only place that included chicken wing tips instead of flats. I've never seen this before. These are usually discarded. I liked them, but not everyone else will.\nWhen I came here it was pretty empty and dead, service was great! I visited BrewDog on a Wednesday for their \u201cWednesday Wings\u201d special, where they offer all-you-can-eat bone-in wings or cauliflower wings. The place itself is beautifully decorated with a fun and inviting atmosphere that really adds to the experience. For the holiday season/Christmas decor.\n\nThe wings were impressive in size\u2014much larger than what you\u2019d typically get at other wing places. This goes for both the chicken and cauliflower wings, which is a big plus. However, while the BBQ flavor was fantastic, Honey adobo was only good on the cauliflower wings not so much the regular bone in wings. Besides that the rest of the flavors were quite plain and didn\u2019t have the boldness I was hoping for, which was a little disappointing.\n\nOn the upside, the service was great! The staff was quick, attentive, and the food came out fast. And I was full and tipsy at the end of it, While I didn\u2019t capture any photos of the food because it didn\u2019t quite wow me, I did take several of the atmosphere\u2014it\u2019s definitely worth visiting for the vibe alone.\n\nOverall, BrewDog is a great spot with solid service and an amazing environment, but the flavors of the wings could use a little more punch to match the hype of their generous portions. I will definitely be coming back and trying other stuff on the menu. Again. Was just here for the beers and to check off a brewery on the Pub Pass tour. We ended up closing it down and being the last ones here. Great atmosphere and vibes. The beers were tasty. Definitely would revisit again."

    "reviews": "So many good things to say about BSB. The food is always amazing and the staff makes you feel like family. If you are reading this - it\u2019s your sign to stop by and enjoy all this place has to offer. THIS REALLY IS THE ONLY BEER I WILL DRINK!!! Thank you Jimmy, Karen, and Emily for making my husband\u2019s graduation party so memorable. We will be back!!! I travel often and always look for good pizza along my journey. Why have I never thought to put cream cheese on pizza as a topping before? Game changer. Best pizza I\u2019ve had since NYC. Staff is so sweet and charming. Also, the Berry Springer slaps! It\u2019s always a good sign when you forget to get a good photo before digging in! Hands down best micro brewery in the district, the beer always tastes fresh like they take care of their products and it's minutes away from my place. Pizza is on point especially the brick style and the $5 slice always hits the spot for my go to lunch bite. My favorite would have to be the \"snowballed\" just because it tastes literally like a pint of summer and love the seasonal rotation to keep it fresh. The food here has always been great but had a bad experience the last time we came in. We had a buy one get one free for drinks coupon and we came during happy hour which includes $4 off a large pie. We presented the coupon when we arrived and the waiter took it and we ordered (we've had this waiter before and he is great). When we checked out, a different waitress came and said there was no coupon and we did not get $4 off the pizza we ordered during happy hour. We were disappointed to say the least since we love this place and have been in many times. Driving through the US right now, stopped in Denver for 48 hours. This was our find as a local small brewery, yet we were not thrilled with the experience, especially after a long day at Rocky Mountains.\n\nArrived, sat down, looked over the menu. About 10+ minutes (It could have been less or more, we were hungry.)\n\nAfter watching the one waitress handling orders walk up to a table, open the wrong seltzer, realize it, and walk away from the table, she approached us and asked \u201cHave you been helped yet?\u201d as if someone else would have taken our order.  We gave her our order, wings, the garlic cheesy bread (yummy) and a flight of beer.\n\nQuite a while later, the food arrived. They forgot the beer. The brewery forgot to serve the beer. I had to walk up to the bar after our food arrived, and re-ask for our flight. The original waitress could be seen in the back on a phone call for the bulk of this experience. The man at the bar was very quick to help out.\n\nWhile I was grabbing the beer, she came up with more garlic cheesy bread, realized we had ours (for at least 5 minutes at this point) and turned around.\n\nBeer was overall pretty good. Enjoyed the flight, Our favorites were the Rapture and the Paint it Black. Very good.  Wings were definitely fresh, which is good. The sauce, buffalo and honey sriracha (if i recall correctly) were good, as well as the ranch served with it. Only complaint is that they could have been slightly crispier, but the wings were big and good. Cheesy garlic bread is a must. Lots of cheese on top of bread knots, fun to eat. We did not get pizza, as prices for pizza are quite high at 24ish for a small pizza (although not sure how big the small pizza is). Price was definitely a deterring factor regardless.\n\nAfter hanging around for a while, we finally walked up to the waitress who was behind the bar now, and asked to check out. She still took some time to come over, and finally checked us out. Turning the little keypad, the options to tip were 20%, 25%, and 30%.  I do not like to tip poorly, even if service is bad, but was highly disappointed that lowest I could do was still higher than I felt service was worth, especially after having to re-ask and grab the beer, again, from a place specializing in beer.\n\nCould have been an off-day, but if she had mentioned or said anything about having messed up a few times, all would have been forgiven. Stuff happens, we all have off days, but it felt a lot like we were being avoided by the waitress for the bulk of the experience, which was extremely weird."

Gumbo, red beans and rice, jambalaya, all very tasty. Prices are great, service is friendly.  You won't be disappointed. Laissez les bons temps roullez. And crayfish boil when in season! Well worth the visit!  Don\u2019t let the strip mall fool you, this place means business!  I had the trio and added jambalaya\u2026.  Very impressed with the food and service.  They pinch above their weight!  Make the trip! I was really surprised by how much I liked this place! My friends and I stopped by on a whim. The food was awesome, and the atmosphere was fun with lots of art. I really felt like I was back in the south!! Definitely will be going again I\u2019ve been getting red beans and rice from Voodoo Tavern for years and it\u2019s always been legit!! Tonight\u2019s batch is the best I\u2019ve had hands down!! First time being in the new spot across the street and I\u2019m happy to see they have a lil more space so more people can enjoy their authentic New Orleans grub!! 4.5/5.  I thought this was a fantastic lunch!  Came here on a sleepy Sunday.  Service was a bit slow, but the food and drinks were awesome!  Pricing is probably par for the course.\n\nDefinitely recommend coming out here for some great NOLA food.  Can\u2019t wait to come back during the winter months!"

This store is outstanding the customer service is over the top they're always very clean very fast service very accurate and extremely helpful. They definitely go over the top to make the customers experience wonderful! I go to Qdoba a lot and this is definitely my new favorite store! I would also like to give a big shout out to a few wonderful ladies Kabeli, Piedael, Jendy, Selena, Karina, and Maria!\nThey are always working so hard and always manage to keep a kind and joyful presence!!! 10/10 \ud83d\udcaf Keep up the great work! Horrible service. Skimpy portions. It was nearly impossible to get a bowl made with what I wanted on it. I just wanted extra steak and extra cheese and they were all stingy. Don't go to this location if you value your dollar. Actually horrible I just ordered from here and let me tell you. I ordered the nachos and it was straight bean juice, half of what I ordered wasn\u2019t in the bowl and there was basically no portions . The other bowl I got was less than half full. It was all flavorless I\u2019m usually not one to complain, but this store sucks. The steak I got in my bowl tasted like campfire and the flavors were all off and tasted bad Yikes! Ordered two burritos, mine was almost completely rice. What happened to the extra beans I ordered and no habanero salsa? Also, the guacamole was bad. I was able to eat most of my burrito because all of the guacamole was at the bottom, however we also ordered a large guacamole, which was also bad. Plus I got a bag of broken chips. Definitely a bummer."

And it took a long time to get my wings, even though it wasn't that busy. Wings were good though, hot and crispy My service was on point last night. I did have to wait 30 mins for a table. But I'm from out of town so it was no problem. My kids were  HUNGRY. The food came out quickly to my surprise. The  manager took time to speak with me and came back to make sure our meal was good. Also my server was great. We watched the Super Bowl and the half time show was lit. \ud83d\udd25 Let's and lots of well placed TVs. I didn't eat yet the place smelled great and was clean. Just what I needed at this great location. After reading other reviews in the area, I decided to come back and get the sampler.....hold for more pics....okay, the smaller was darn good. For 16 bucks, you get a lot. Drinks were good . Patio was quiet and lots of spaces. Check it out if your around! I usually love Buffalo Wild Wings but this experience was horrible. We walked in and a hostess seated us and it took about 10 minutes before our server even passed by our table. We asked for a 2 for 20 menu and it took another 10 minutes before he came back, we placed our drink order and it was another 10 minutes before our server came to take our order. Several tables received their food before we did even though they came in and placed their order after we did. In total we were at the restaurant for 1 hour and 30 minutes and we never received our food. After speaking to the manager she didn\u2019t offer any vouchers or ask us any questions other than \u201cwhere did you sit\u201d and \u201cI\u2019m sorry\u201d it\u2019s obvious that this location is extremely short staffed and is under poor management. We ended up going to in n out where we received our food quickly and experienced great service. AVOID THIS LOCATION if you\u2019re hungry and want to eat in a reasonable time. Huge shoutout to Olivia and Marshall, the amazing managers at Buffalo Wild Wings Stapleton in Denver! Their generous donation of wings will help feed the youth attending our Bridging Sports Career Exploration Fair next Wednesday at the Athletics & Beyond Family Wellness Center in Montbello. Thanks to them, our kids will enjoy a delicious meal while exploring pathways in sports and career development. We truly appreciate the support and community spirit!"

    "reviews": "Overall good experience. The staff were decent. They made my food quickly. I ordered a beef burrito and cheese with chips. They both were tasty and had good flavor. A good quick bite and an excellent example of this chain. They are not stingy with fixins.. But service is horrible when it comes to customers complaint..called them in regards to my order today..we stopped in on the way to asoccer game so we were in a hurry.didnt check food..got to field and the burritos were hard, we ordered steak and it had chicken mixed in...my bowl the lid wasnt properly sealed so when we opened bag most fell out and what i coulf salvage the chicken was hard..i called and spoke with to manager and they wanted me to drive back there from springs to return the food bfr they would help us..so u expect us to bring food back.i dont understand why u would tell someone to bring that back.Wow..just horrible.. I was extremely dissatisfied with the protein portion I received\u2014just barely more than half a scoop, which is unacceptable. When I ordered fajitas, I expected more than the measly four flimsy strips of bell peppers and three sad little onions I got. This experience is not an isolated incident; I have repeatedly been let down by this location. I will definitely be avoiding it in the future. Order this.\nBad boy to pilot truck.Stop to my truck came fast.It was well worth it ten stars out I was ordering food and they understood everything, helped me pick stuff out and when I went to sit down and eat, the food was amazing."

    "reviews": "Delicious and the staff is very friendly and welcoming !!! We all ordered something different. The chicken and waffles were good, chicken was juicy, along side with that stuffed french toast, amazing!! The mango margarita was the perfect touch to this bruch! Our server was very attentive and took good care of us. She handled our individual orders and got everything right. I'm definitely going back with the fam.! Check them out Come here for DRINKS ONLY! They have a great vibe for hanging out to watch sports and have drinks. The staff is nice and service is great. On the other hand, the FOOD IS GARBAGE. I\u2019ve tried this place out twice and both times was disappointment. We did not finish the food. \ud83e\udd2e This is not a place you get mexican food. Better off going to 7-11 and getting a tacquito off the rack than food at this establishment. Great spot for some mexican cuisine, delicious drinks and their loaded fries. Servers can definitely be more attentive, they will check on you after you sit down and then disappear for a while. Also to go orders we got lately have no sauces, no salsa for the chips, no napkins. Otherwise great place to get some food. Husband had the biscuits and gravy - biscuit was so hard couldn\u2019t break with a fork.  I had the harvest skillet which was potatoes cooked with so much oil I couldn\u2019t tell if they were deep fried or pan fried.   The veggies were a plate of fajita veggies with a small cut of zucchini.  I was really looking forward to trying this place - disappointed. Picture is of the harvest skillet and pieces of the too hard to eat biscuit and gravy. I enjoy the food and drinks from here, this place has always been enjoyable up until now. I have been coming here for years and the current staff looks like they don't want to be here, they also seem quite rude. They don't even greet or show anyone to their tables like they used to.\n\nIt took them a while to get me my pick up order and another while to get my drinks out, the place wasn't even busy. Until the staff returns to how it was I'm giving it 3 stars only because the food and drinks are good (they have some of the best margaritas imo,) and past experiences have been great."

    "reviews": "Eric was amazing !!! We came for a family trip and were playing Yahtzee in the outdoor area and even though he was not serving out there he brought our to go order to us !!! We came back for breakfast which was delicious and perfect guess WHO we saw again Eric \ud83d\ude00. Jess was a fabulous server and I loved talking with her about the local area!!! This place is a diamond within a beautiful setting. A little on the pricey side but definitely worth it if you want an upscale moment for yourself or for a first date. Beautiful fun attentive staff and exceptional drinks and exquisite food. Period. There is nothing creative on the menu. I ordered the wings without celery. I don\u2019t like celery and didn\u2019t want to be wasteful. The celery came regardless. 3 celery sticks with 1 carrot. The wings were by no means above average and were over priced. The waitress greeted me when I came in and said sit anywhere. She failed to say \u201cnot in the breakfast section to the right\u201d. The food was just ok but not great and definitely not worth the overpriced.  Also, the description on the menu didnt match well what you get. Does the picture looks like plank salmon to you?  Good wasn't warm enough either. Oh well, at least too my hunger away. Their burger looked good but no idea how good would it be. The table next to us ordered one. Delicious steak and truffle fries. Side ceaser was huge but delicious. Never been a fan of hotel restaurant food but I'll definitely go again"

    "reviews": "Great experience!\nNEV was knowledgeable about the menu and offerings. Very kind, courteous, helpful! The farmhouse sandwich was \u201con point!\u201d\nShe definitely elevates this brand! Please make sure she gets recognized for her hard work! Thanks team! Ordered a chorizo sunrise with a green chili bagel and received a chorizo sunrise on some cranberry bagel. Ordered through DoorDash and they won\u2019t fix the problem and this store doesn\u2019t seem to answer there phone. Who in there right mind puts a chorizo sunrise on a cranberry bagel???? Stupid mistake done by people that don\u2019t give a shit about the product that they SELL. If there was less then one start I would leave it. Overall pretty good.  Haven\u2019t been to an EBB in years.  The food was good but lacking definitely not even close to the pictures of what you will get, especially the brisket sandwich.  Employees were not very friendly and the lady that helped me seemed really annoyed with taking my order.  However it was fast and we got the last jalape\u00f1o bagel which is what I wanted.  One recommendation I would give is set up a place for tap water, I don\u2019t believe everyone in the world should have to buy water and it would be nice to have a self serve if you do not have a dispenser. This location has just digressed more each year. Food quality has definitely gone down. Today we were served burnt bagel sandwiches. It wasn't busy yet we waited quite awhile for 2 bagels. Where are the tables?? Used to have more tables and places to sit. Now its one long table with 8 chairs, a long bench with 2 small tables. Worst part was management did nothing about a lady sitting on the end of the bench with her big hairy dog taking up most of the bench. Dog had a leash attached but got up several times walking over to condiments area and up to others. I love dogs but I'm allergic to dogs! There is no reason for dogs to be in restaurants or stores!! This lady wasn't even a customer. Now everyone who comes in, not knowing a dog was there, will be sitting in dog hair and dog slobber. Einsteins certainly not wiping down tables/benches. This store is not clean. BRING BACK SOME TABLES AND KEEP ANIMALS OUT!!! Don\u2019t waste your time going to this location. I placed an online order at 7:15 am. I get there at 7:45. When I got there, there was a very huge line of people waiting to place orders and pick up orders. No staff acknowledging just them hanging behind the counter. After 10 minutes I told them I placed an online order. The cashier says \u201coh well we don\u2019t have it ready, we are backed up on orders, don\u2019t have bagels and its going to be a 30 minute wait maybe.\u201d Then I told her okay well can I get a refund I can\u2019t wait that long. She said oh you need to call the number on the website\u2026 what number? It has been a week since I sent an email to the CateringSupport@bagelbrands.com and have not heard a response yet. My frustration is if you know people get bagels before heading to work why not start making them earlier? We do our part to place an order why can\u2019t you respect our time. They were barely starting batches of bagels with so many online orders and walk in orders. Or if you don\u2019t have the capacity to make them, stop accepting online orders instead of making people waste their time and money. Will not be going back EVER."

    "reviews": "The food is decent. Our egg rolls were mushy and a little rubbery. As well as the pot stickers. I wouldn't recommend those two items. The roll was good and decently priced. The crab salad was a little warm which was a little off putting but the taste was good. If you're a vegetarian and a fan of bold flavors, this Asian restaurant is a must-visit!\n\nI tried their spicy Korean tofu noodle soup, and wow\u2014what an experience. The rich broth was packed with fiery heat and a hint of smokiness, perfectly balanced by the silkiness of the tofu and the chewiness of the noodles. It's a flavor explosion with every bite, warming you to the core. Plus, the bowl is huge! (Check out the picture\u2014it's bigger than an adult hand x2) Definitely worth every penny for the portion size and quality.\n\nCraving sushi? Their peanut avocado roll was the perfect sidekick to my soup. Creamy avocado, the crunch of peanuts, and a touch of sweetness\u2014simple yet so satisfying. I highly recommend both dishes for a memorable, vegetarian-friendly meal.\n\nThis place has officially made it to my favorites list. I can\u2019t wait to return! Just had an incredible lunch at Pan Gu and I\u2019m beyond impressed. Everything we ordered was delicious\u2014from the fresh, flavorful sushi to the perfectly cooked chicken teriyaki and the crispy, savory sesame chicken. The crab Rangoon was rich and creamy with just the right crunch, and the wonton soup was comforting and full of flavor. We also had the pan-fried potstickers, which were perfectly crisped and packed with flavor. Every dish was clearly made with care and tasted absolutely fabulous. Great service, great atmosphere\u2014Pan Gu is a gem. Highly recommend! Nice little spot to grab a quick bite. Plenty of options. The food and service are fanatic. Sushi is on point. We also got the Mongolian beef and it was great.\n\nOnly reason the atmosphere isn\u2019t rated higher is just cause they don\u2019t have many decorations and whatnot. Fun music though. Would give it a 3.5 if I could. From Tampa Florida, wake up!!!!\n\nBest place within 20 miles.  Hands down.\n\nI was here two years ago and just checked it out again in 2025.  Still steaming \u2026.Go!\nBetter than pizza next dooor\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026."

Speed of the food was excellent! Taste of the food was outstanding! Overall, glad I came in! Thanks guys for doing a great job tonight! Food was really good. I got the new hot honey chicken on the skillet with waffle fries. My wife got the prime rib dip sandwich and for dessert we got the little cinnamon bites. The food was delicious and brought out very quickly. Our server David was fantastic, fun, engaging and very very efficient! Easily one of the best servers we\u2019ve had the pleasure of having and meeting! Kudos David \ud83d\ude01. Food was ordered Togo by my wife. Supposed to do the curb side thing. She sat for over 10 mins then just went in and got it. Fries legit barely cooked at all. And prime Rib sandwich was falling apart and horrible took one bite . Which is sad cause I was starving.... As a cook fellow cook  yall need to be better , that is just pathetic effort.  Wanna complain and try to get some food that doesn't suck. But I am not liking my chances of them being better next time . Be better!!! Romi was a very wonderful waitress and had no issues fixing any of the problems that I had had with my food and I truly appreciate her.She is sweet and I will be coming back again after another trip.When I decide to travel. Thank you for your hospitality, and I hope that one day you will serve halal food so I can bring my family and more customers to this business. This is our favorite Applebees location. The food is always delicious and served in a timely manner. Frankie and David are absolutely the best servers. We enjoy chatting with them and we never have to ask for drink refills. They both are the reason we love going there every week. All servers we have had there are great as well. Never have had a bad experience at this location."

    "reviews": "Don\u2019t come here. Every individual employed at this location is incompetent at best. I ordered inside the restaurant and it took over 20 mins. for them to get my order wrong. I had already walked out of the establishment when I realized this, so I decided to try my hand at the drive-thru. I shouldn\u2019t have given them a second chance to mess up my order because that\u2019s just what they did yet again.\n\nThe drive-thru was indeed quicker, and they did get my order closer this time, however still not correct - I received a spicy version of what I ordered instead of a regular. I\u2019ve only eaten at Wendy\u2019s a handful of times in my life and this might just be my last. Definitely at this location at least! Almost half the tables were dirty if I come here when  the managers, not here there\u2019s no such thing as customer service half the staff doesn\u2019t speak English and all they worry about is the drive thru and completely ignore the front counter also manager will hide in back and not speak to customers requesting to speak to a manager and the food I almost bit and handle with my bare hands that wasn\u2019t what I ordered they took back and gave to another customer in drive thru. Also the young lady will mess up your food on purpose if she doesn\u2019t like you and the team will back her up and say that is how the food was supposed to be until you make them read the ingredients of the sandwich that I had to pull from the Wendy\u2019s app just to prove what comes on my sandwich This picture was taken 5min after  I picked up food. I was not about to teach anyone in the phone think they have wrong number asks you to enter code then hangs up so couldn't get refund Apparently \"drive thru\" orders are the focus. When we arrived we noticed the long drive thru line. We proceeded inside to be forced to use a kiosk to order a chicken sandwich and a salad (to go).\nThe dining room was totally empty, and our wait to get our basic order took 20 minutes \ud83d\ude35\u200d\ud83d\udcab.\nWhen we went outside... There was nobody waiting in the drive thru line \ud83d\ude21\ud83e\udd2c\ud83e\udd2c...\n* There was one older lady and a young man putting the orders together, and there were 4 young ladies doing absolutely nothing behind the counter.... \ud83e\udd37\ud83d\ude35\u200d\ud83d\udcab\ud83e\udd14 We had mishap with our order and had to go back. One of the Employees Jimmy, single handedly corrected everything, all while running the drive through. I believe this kind of customer service is what's missing today. We think Jimmy needs a raise."

I especially liked the green sauce that came with it. The caprese with balsamic glaze was our favorite though. Ordered tiramisu for the entire family & everyone really enjoyed it. Perfect hole in the wall small local pizzeria that pulled me in with their Al Pastor pizza. I was not disappointed and scarfed the 10\u201d pie in record time! They have 4 small booths and 2 little tables so appears most of their business is takeout. Place was hopping when we went with fast friendly service cranking out the pizzas in no time! I ordered takeout online, and I read enjoyed the food. The al pastor pizza was very good. The cheese bread and mozzarella sticks were so fantastic, and the marinara it came with was good. I paid like $25 for everything as well, so it was a very great value. I will definitely come back again. Decided to stop by for a carry out pizza since  we were heading to the airport for our flight out & they did not disappoint! The Spicy Italian pizza was so delicious. Will definitely come back again every time we\u2019re in town. This one is going on my favorites list for a revisit when I'm back in Denver. I had the Central Park Caprese which is seasonal. It was fantastic! The staff was very friendly. Seating is limited but the pizza is tremendous!"

The price was comparable to other breakfast places. The service was great. It's a small bar, but there's plenty of seating. I'm glad we tried it. Its a cool little neighborhood bar that has a new cafe inside, called Joe Mama's cafe. And it is to die for... It is separate from the bar. The Ladies that Bartend there are all really sweet and on it.\nAll except an older  Bitchy Drama Queen that works the 11 to 7 shift. Badass Happy Hour!

Kitchen wasn't open when I visited during last Sundays football game.\nGood strong drinks!  So that was a plus!"

The bar and the bathrooms are always clean and it\u2019s always a good day if Mike is behind the bar! Cheers!!! Love this place. The beer is great and we really like the pizza too. For sure a go to for us with friends from up north as it is a good mid point.  Great work on the beer and keep the east coast transplant coming!\n\nFYI, the daily specials on the weekday are amazing, but the online version looks to be outdated. I'm posting the Pic of the updated specials as of 12/23/24. Stopped in for a beer and food. Beer is fantastic and the pizza (Margherita) is absolutely awesome. Just got back from Napoli and the pizza is similar to here. Phenomenal! Must have. Had the Nine Barley wine age stout and West Coast IPA. Sooo Good! Well done! Cheers! Very busy place last night with lots of tables and food beers. They had a trivia night which was starting at 7p in the back and since I was leaving soon didn\u2019t try to join. Tried a few IPAS and they were pretty tasty. Did smaller sampler sizes. Had a pizza trunk out front that made smaller size pizzas that looked good just too full to eat here too. It was worth the drive Finally visited The newest location! I prefer this one since the parking was a lot better than og spot.\n\nAlways Great beers on tap and for cans to go.\n\nThey had an oven fire Pizza truck for food that day I opted for the Olives.\n\nFriendly staff and the place was clean."

    "reviews": "The most unique bowl of yogurt I\u2019ve ever had for breakfast. It comes with a thin waffle lining the bowl, fresh quality fruit, big chunks of yummy granola, and quality yogurt drizzled with honey, at a knock out price!\n\nIt\u2019s too bad I\u2019m just passing through on my way back to NM, but I\u2019ll remember this little hole in the wall the next time I come out here! My daughter recommended it, and I'm so glad I wandered in. Robin and crew can not only cook delightful dishes, like her special fried-ice cream waffle, they also connect with the community they serve. We will be back for more creative specials of the day, and to try her World Famous Sloppy Joe... I can safely say the exterior is not at all representative of the food quality, such that I regret not stopping in over the past year. That's a compliment to be clear. I will definitely be returning next time I'm in the area.\n\nIf the crowd this morning was any indication, others share this opinion too. This food is tasty!\n\nI recommend giving the specials a look. I saw another review with a photo of the French Toast and got exactly what I hoped for. Delicious fresh and homey french toast with bacon and eggs and a well presented side of fruit. Service was wonderful and attentive, ensuring my coffee was never cold nor low. The vibe is the best a dive-bar has to offer with lots of locals but surprisingly quiet atmosphere--  a welcome reprieve from the noisy trendy breakfast spots. Did some work as folks played pool and watched a football game on mute. you can feel the love in the food! and the 2 for 1 drinks were amazing. $6 delicious bloody marys! I love this place"

Customers were all friendly. Great casual atmosphere. OMG, they're hamburgers are the bomb half-price on Mondays. We ordered the cream cheese jalapeno hamburger, Me and my girlfriend came there for lunch today. The bartender was very friendly guy. I definitely will be coming here more often The Best chili dogs and fries in town. And the 5 star service was nice also. Went there the first time 5 years ago, liked it right away. If it's sunny any day of the year its a great patio, great people too, and you get to meet people's dogs as well, good kiddos. Wings Wednesday is great, they used to have a good guy named Corey playing guitar and singing, but he's on tour this summer. Not just a bar for bikers but ride yours if you got one! Traveling through on my way back home to Arizona stopped in Wheat Ridge Co .. found this place on Google map restaurant finder.  Loved the atmosphere and the food. Yes there was only one bartender but she was very attentive to our needs during our meal.  Would definitely stop again if I ever come back through the Denver area."

    "reviews": "The service was great. Ordered ahead. You pick your pizza up at the trailer and pay inside the brewery. For the price, the pizza is small, so not a lot of value. The pizza itself was decent, but exceptionally salty. I am not sure if they made a mistake measuring the salt that day, but oh boy, was it salty. The pizzas are an odd size. Maybe enough for two not very hungry people, or enough for one hungry person. I may try it again. I cannot believe their pizza would normally be so incredibly salty. Color me impressed! I consider myself somewhat of a pizza connoisseur, and this is hands down the best sour dough pizza place I\u2019ve tried in Colorado. The crust was perfectly crispy where it needed to be, but still soft and chewy elsewhere. The cheeses they used were worlds better than other places I\u2019ve tried, and the sauce was delightful. Joshua was extremely friendly and made me feel welcome, and I was glad that the customer service was just as awesome as the food! Definitely try the cheesy bread too while you\u2019re here, it was different than anything I\u2019ve ever had, the spices used worked beautifully! I highly recommend this spot. \ud83d\udc4d Amazing pizza. I grew up in the northeast and have had lots of great pizza. This place is LEGIT. Super nice people, great pizza- the pepperoni pizza made me cry tears of joy. Sausage was great too. Beer was delicious. Cool dog patio. I couldn\u2019t believe they had the audacity to hand us our pizza looking like this. The other side was tasty but given how long we had been waiting we just ate what we could of it and left."

    "reviews": "Made the trek up The Grateful Gnome yesterday afternoon for grub, music, and a cold beer.  It was a very successful trip for all the items. The place was *packed* but we managed to snag a spot at the end of the bar. The staff was wonderful and handled the crowd with ease.  I loved the cheese steak, my husband had the meatball parm,  our friend had the Buffalo chicken wrap and we all split the huge order of fries.  We tried a couple of the beers, with my favorite being the Mountain lair Lager.\n\nWe'll definitely be making the drive up again soon! Stopped by for lunch on a beautiful Sunday afternoon - the patio was open, but we ate at the bar. Had a little bit of a hard time deciding what to order - but thank goodness it's close by and can try more items soon. 1st visit & both the  food and drinks  \ud83e\udd0c\ud83e\udd0c We really enjoyed the wings in the Prudy sauce (it\u2019s like Buffalo). I ordered the mini sloppy gnome and thought it was a bit dry, but after asking for a side of the 1000 island, it was great! The cuban was very good as well. The gf bread isn\u2019t the best, but it\u2019s not bad. The fries are frustratingly coated in a flour blend, so not gf. I will be back to listen to some live music and try more stuff off the menu! We liked the ambiance, and staff was super kind. \"Grate\" sandwiches in many varieties. Fun atmosphere that's family friendly yet offers a full bar, homemade brews, and live sports. Helpful and friendly staff make for an enjoyable dining and entertainment experience. Love the Wings! Love the beer! Love the friendly staff and certainly love the gnomes! My gf said the cheesesteak sandwich was bomb. Must go back to try more options!"

    "reviews": "The food here is amazing! The food deserves the five-star rating. The only downside to the restaurant is it definitely doesn't have a relaxed atmosphere. Just due to the design and layout and the way they operate, it's more of a fast paced restaurant.  If you're looking for a relaxing night on the town this may not be the best spot but for excellent food it definitely is! WONDERFUL pizza!  I've only ever ordered takeout from PARISI, but the food is always delicious, perfectly cooked, and ready on time (or slightly early!).  I find the prices are very reasonable, especially given the quality of the food.\n\nI can't recommend this restaurant enough.  The website is a little weird - to-go customers will want to select the \"fast and casual\" option.  As a hungry runner, I can honestly eat an 11 inch Margherita by myself.   If two people want to share a pizza, I'd suggest going for the 14 inch. It felt like we were in New York. Very high energy place with families and young adults. The food was fantastic - hot, delicious, and plentiful. We share these three items and still had take home. The pizza was very good as was the lentil soup which was full of lentils! I love this place.  The bread is great.  The menu is huge.  And everything I have had here has been top notch.  The Eggplant Parm is excellent.  My only complaint is, since you order at a counter, you do not have full service.  Getting a refilled water proved a minor challenge.  Always excellent service at the front counter for dessert!  I love it here.  Someday I want to eat downstairs for dinner.... To start, the service there was excellent. We came in with a big party and they were pretty full. To accommodate us they gave some customers free desert to move for us! The servers were warm and quick. And it has a cool atmosphere. The food was a little hit and miss. ( full disclosure i am Italian and grew up with great Italian food\u2026 or as we called it \u201cfood\u201d. ) The sausage and pepper pizza was very good. I loved the sausage, the sauce was solid and peppers done right. The crusts were good. The Cesar salad was lame and the capris salad was ok. The capris pizza was solid."

    "reviews": "Long over due review!  My wife and I love this place.  All around good vibes and an awesome atmosphere.  We have been coming here for 8 years now, and it\u2019s still our favorite neighborhood bar by far.  Jay is the absolute man and let us throw a birthday party for my wife in the back room.  Couldn\u2019t have asked for a better night.  The entire staff is awesome but a special shout out to Brenna we love you dude! Cheers Great cocktails, and the best neighborhood focused vibe. Always great service, and the owner is always doing creative things.  Bands, outdoor seating and first Friday celebrations abound. Ummm, this was some of the most lovely surprises I\u2019ve had in a while. We were just strolling by when we heard the most glorious voice (turned out to be the owner) bellowing out the open windows letting us know they had brunch cocktails to go. So, while waiting for our table next door we popped inside for a quick drink. Well, we were there a total of maybe 9 mins, but in those 9 minutes we lived a FULL life.\n\nI had one of the best bloody Mary\u2019s I\u2019ve had in ages (dill-forward in the BEST way \ud83e\udd24), blew bubbles (\ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f), voted for which of three non-profits I wanted to receive their quarterly donation (\ud83d\ude0d), and drank a mimosa from a champagne bong (\ud83d\udc6f\ud83c\udf89).\n\nFun was had. Drinks were delicious. Cackles were cackled. This was one of those magical moments with friends that are impossible to curate...you just have to put yourself out there and hope you stumble upon a gem like this.\n\n10/10. HARD Do Recommend. My favorite bar. Good cocktails, great service, solid beer selection. Lots of outdoor seating. The drinks were great but the fact that they ask you what you\u2019re gonna tip and then shame you and make you tip a higher amount was really weird. I loved the bar but probably won\u2019t return."

    "reviews": "The fish taco was phenomenal!! Drinks were amazing!! The staff were so nice!! Definitely my first stop next time I\u2019m in town! Trying this place for my first time, I was pretty disappointed in the food unfortunately. My burger came out wrong and all of the food was seriously lacking flavor.\n\nI ordered the bacon & cheese stuffed burger but unfortunately they gave me a regular burger, which I ended up eating. That was the first disappointment. The burger had one slice of cheese and 2 pieces of bacon that didn't have much of a flavor, the burger overall was seriously lacking flavor. One slice of cheese on a burger that thick is not enough. The burger wasn't seasoned, the whole thing was flavorless. On top of that the waitress did not correct the price when I told them of the discrepancy, nor did they ask to fix the incorrect food.\n\nI was excited seeing shoestring fries, but unfortunately they were lacking as well. The fries weren't crispy and just room temp.\n\nWe also had the slow roasted pork torta, it was alright. The guacamole was good, the pork seemed to be lacking some flavor, as it took time to actually tatse it. The jus that came with it had a kick to it.\n\nThe tortilla chips are flour and have been salted. The salsa was average.\n\nService was seriously lacking, with just one person for  wait staff. They never came around to ask about food or anything. We had to flag them down.\n\nBeyond that the interior is nice and it seems like a nice little spot. I wish I had a better experience. Amazing happy hour offers - fantastic tacos and margaritas! Food and vibes were great. I have been here twice and it's the perfect little/cozy joint to grab a margarita and some Latin infused food. We always sit at the bar for the full bar/bartender interaction experience. They have an excellent selection of tequilas and the vibe is chill. I will probably be back when in Denver. I wish google would allow us to add 4 1/2 star ratings because for me this place falls somewhere in the middle of a 4 and a 5. Billy\u2019s has great food, no doubt\u2014but what really sets this place apart is the staff and the atmosphere. My 4-year-old son and I have been coming here regularly for a couple of years now, and this is literally the only restaurant he ever wants to eat at. The team always makes an effort to talk to him and engage, and even during those early days when he had a hard time sitting still at the table, not once did anyone act like he was a problem. That kind of patience and kindness goes a long way.\n\nSavannah is always welcoming and greets us with a smile\u2014even on the busiest nights. And of course, I can\u2019t leave out Daniel, the GOAT of bartenders. The whole crew makes you feel like family, and that\u2019s why we keep coming back. Also Mary and Racina\u2019s smiles and service are the cherries on top!"

    "reviews": "I was here with my kid for lunch, and it feels much more bar than restaurant to me, so I probably wasn't utilizing the space in the right way. Food was ok though and server was very nice. The regulars seemed to me enjoying themselves. But also it's the kind of place that has regulars at 1pm on a Wednesday. Oh lord did this place rip me off!!! I attended the Friends themed trivia this week. I was extremely excited as I am a huge fan. I purchased a ticket for a table of 5 that was priced at $45. I thought this was a bit steep to attend trivia but it said it came with an appetizer for the table and its a themed trivia (expected to be full). Alright, we will get a big appetizer since there are 5 of us. WRONG. Bartender tells us we can only choose between pickle chips or chili cheese fries. I wanted the monkey fries and was told no that it not an option. WHY NOT? The appetizers are also $8.... EIGHT. So okay, the $45 did not come from the appetizer. I go to talk to the trivia guy and he lets me know that the money does not go to him and he gets a flat rate from everywhere he provides trivia. OKAY. Still trying to give the benefit of the doubt.... Maybe its because this is a highly sought out event for fans. WRONG. There are 6 teams TOTAL. Also!!!! Most of these teams walked in and just played trivia. THEY DID NOT PAY FOR A TICKET!!! SO you mean to tell me I paid $45 to get a small little appetizer that is worth $8 that is not enough to feed 5 people. My friends and I all bought drinks so we still supported OUTSIDE of the ticket price. The whole point of trivia is to drive up business in food and drink. I love to support trivia and local business, I go to many! The bartender was also not the nicest but I can recognize that he was busy and they seemed to be short staffed. And I imagine he is not the one who told me the overpriced ticket....l really wanted to love this place and I honestly was very disappointed. I was so excited and this was a major letdown :( Adam was amazing the food was delicious very welcoming made me feel at home not like the family you argue with but like the family you feel comfortable with Stopped in from out of town with some buddies and DANG was that an A+ move. Tired and hungry from a long morning of travel, ordered the double smash burg. Grabbed a beer waiting for the burger and OMG, life paused for a moment. The bar waitress was no lie the most beautiful female in the entire world. And also the most down to earth, chill chick. Hooked it up with a nice pour of IPA which tasted oh so sweet. Back to the burger, it was TEN out of TEN. So solid. This place is an oasis in the desert. Will be going back if I\u2019m ever in Denver again. I hope the bar angel is still there serving up perfect pints and good conversation. I like coming here when they host the crawfish boils but you should know that when they host boils there will be no tables available unless you are a large group and you reserved them ahead of time. They do not do any sort of time slots on those tables so people can come at 1/2PM for a boil that starts at 12 and hold that table until 5PM. Bring your own chairs and even a mini table if you can so you eat your food comfortably.\n\nMoney Barrel - you should consider time slots for the tables so they\u2019re reserved for 5 hours! Would be far more economical for you and beneficial to other people who want an opportunity to sit down while they eat."

    "reviews": "Cute place with a pet-friendly large turfed outdoor area with small tables and picnic tables. There is a play set for kids which was nice. Plenty of indoor seating as well. Menu was small and a few things I asked about were out of stock - they were out of bagels and soup. I got the lox bagel, but since they didn't any any bagels I got it on sour dough. It was underwhelming unfortunately. Didnt have many capers or cream cheese or onion.. it was just lacking all-around honestly... for ~$17 it was a failure. I would not get that again. My husband got the buffalo chicken sandwich with potato salad. His meal was significantly better. The potato salad was a nice size and consistency. The sandwich was good! This place wasn't too busy but it did take a bit for the food to come out. We also got drinks: i got a large hot matcha latte which was very good. My husband got hot drip coffee which he said was cold after added a little cream. We were on our way to our Air BnB in Bailey and were looking for a quick bite to eat and found this place. Really good take on the BBQ Chicken Pizza and the Bacon Lettuce Avacado Tomato sandwich was the perfect light bite after traveling all day. My first time going here was great! Just enjoyed a good caramel ice coffee and a blueberry muffin. Very clean and quiet! There is a bar that I would like to try soon. I recommend if you need a quick coffee this is your place. Very clean. Don\u2019t go here, they will mess up your order.\n\nI used to come here frequently but its taken a serious down turn in service, quality, and price the past year. My order has been messed up more times than not with minimal effort to correct it when asked, service is slow, their point of sale system defaults to 25% tip on top of all the fees they charge.\n\nYou won\u2019t get food poisoning here and the atmosphere is nice but that\u2019s about the only praise I can give. Save your money and a headache and go to one of the other wonderful coffee shops nearby. This place massively fell off in the last year. Their mochas are now like drinking watered down chocolate milk, and they never have enough bagels ever.\n\nSave yourself the trouble and go to Cherry Bean right around the corner. Better food and much better coffee. You'll thank me later \ud83d\ude0a"

I always buy their Barbacoa by pound to make tacos, and it\u2019s delicious! Fresh and easy to make tacos and not expensive at all compared to other places, would definitely recommend. The barbacoa was great. True Ju\u00e1rez style barbacoa.\n\nUpdate: yup, still good Such delicious menu. Reminds me of my grandma's house..not just the food but also the family vibe they give. Leaving me calm knowing my food will be done to perfection... Stopped in to have some lunch. The food was good! Had a torta de Carne Asada. The green salsa they have is really good as well.  Service was really good. They made sure our table was clean before sitting and made sure to we were taken care of."

    "reviews": "Amazing for any time of day. It\u2019s our go-to favorite Asian restaurant. We moved to Northern CO recently and still make the trek just to get the food. Service is always amazing, it\u2019s clean, excellent date night vibes, and trendy feel. Highly recommend. As a discerning diner with a particular palate for Chinese food, I've explored countless restaurants in Denver, but Pepper Asian Bistro II remains my unwavering favorite. Its chic atmosphere, coupled with its exceptional culinary offerings, creates an unforgettable dining experience.\n\nTwo dishes that consistently elevate my dining experience are the Walnut Shrimp and the Happy Family. The Walnut Shrimp is a masterpiece \u2013 tender shrimp, delicately coated in a sweet and savory sauce, adorned with crunchy walnuts. It's a symphony of flavors and textures that never fails to delight.\n\nThe Happy Family is a culinary favorite, featuring a harmonious blend of chicken, beef, shrimp, and scallops, stir-fried to perfection with vibrant vegetables. It's a feast for the senses, showcasing the restaurant's expertise in balancing flavors and creating visually stunning dishes.\n\nBeyond the delectable food, Pepper Asian Bistro II offers a chic and inviting ambiance. The modern decor, soft lighting, and attentive service create a sophisticated atmosphere that complements the exquisite dining experience.\n\nIf you're seeking a truly memorable Chinese dining experience in Denver, Pepper Asian Bistro II is the ultimate destination. The shrimp fried rice is also a favorite served with large plump juicy shrimp. They also do delivery when you just don\u2019t want to leave your house. Pepper Asian Bistro II is a fantastic spot for delicious Asian food in Denver that won't break the bank! It's some of the best in town - you won't regret going here!  The service is always friendly, and we've  always had great meals here. This time, we started with the Cheese Wontons and Chicken Gyoza, which were both excellent! For our main course, we shared the Sesame Chicken which had perfectly crispy chicken in a delicious sweet and savory sauce.\n\nWe've also enjoyed the Egg Drop Soup and Walnut Shrimp on other visits. Some of our other favorites include the Spring Rolls, Pad Thai, and Orange Chicken.  Pepper Asian Bistro II has a wonderful atmosphere for a casual meal with friends or family, plus they offer takeout and delivery.  Highly recommend! We were driving through the area and found this hidden gem! The Mongolian Beef was excellent.  Loved that the Orange Chicken came with veggies. And all we ate was delish! We appreciate the attentiveness, Feng!\nThey have a bar area with TVs. Outside dining on their backside patio. No kids menu. Great vibe! Food is good just plating better presentation needed as they look a bit plain with no garnishes. Ordered two sets of beef and fried rice, all tasted fine. Our server was friendly and checked in often. There was an older waitress at the restaurant who was talking loudly about her tips. She called from the other side of the room to ask her coworker about the amount of tip then openly bragged or complained about it. It's quite a classless act and shouldn't be done within earshot of other customers. It made my lunch unpleasant as I had to constantly hear her talking about it."

Dog Haus delivers an exceptional experience for hot dog lovers. The **Chili the Kid** is easily the star of the show, offering one of the best chili dog I've ever had. The chili is rich and flavorful, perfectly complementing the high-quality beef.\n\nThe **Fonz** is a delightful mix of savory flavors, with spicy Italian sausage topped with pastrami, mozzarella, and French's crispy onions. It's a hearty and indulgent treat.\n\nThe **Corn Dog** is also a must-try, with a crispy outer layer and a juicy hot dog inside. It\u2019s the perfect nostalgic bite with an upgraded twist.\n\nOverall, Dog Haus offers a unique and delicious take on classic comfort foods, making it a go-to spot for anyone craving a gourmet hot dog experience. The food: bar quality, wide variety. The fries and tots were good. DIdn't have a chance to taste the hot dogs, actually - we opted for burgers. They are on hawaiian rolls, so they are sweeter and soft.\n\nIt was also setup like a beer garden, which meant we would grab our own forks and stuff. Seat yourself kind of vibe.\n\nAs for the staff, the bartender was great! Fun and engaging. The girl who took our food order seemed a bit new, but nothing to complain about. Overall, I do like the food and the vibe. While the food was delicious, I will only go back if I have an hour to eat, apparently. I ordered a single dog with fries and a drink, but after 25 minutes I had to go and ask what was going on. I never got an apology, nothing was said after I gave them the order number, they just walked past me to other people. I finally had to ask for my food to-go because I had no time. Still, no apology or anything, just: \"here's your food, have a nice day.\" 9/10 this guy at the bar took our order but it took like 45 min to be ready even there wasn't a lot of people"

An excellent draft beer selection to boot make this a solid choice for anyone looking for a decent feed and a few beers with friends. Really cool place and food was very good. We were on a tight schedule, but our server was very attentive and the food was really good! Can be a hit or miss, the last two times we sat at the bar the service was either rude, slow, or would ignore us. This place is not the same it was 10 years ago or even 5.\n\nThe food is ok, the drinks are good. It doesn't get packed as it used to, maybe only on fight nights. Would recommend sitting at a table over the bar as service is a bit quicker. I asked fr onion rings and this is what I got!! I don't know but for me this not even  close to what I asked for. Also if well they are super cheap! I wasn't told they had an extra charge as a side.\nMc and cheese were like a  hole mass, and French fries were meeeh. Husband and I went to the oldest bar in Demver, over 150 years old. Lived up to the name, good food, good drink selection. Got two burgers and fries/rings combo. Came with a tray of mustard, ketchup, relish, pickles, onions, and yellow peppers. Friendly waitress, has indoor and outdoor seating. Will come back again and try more!"

    "reviews": "The signature sauce is flavorful . The chicken needs to be fried a bit longer because the crust is plentiful .Chicken fried rice was on point .Location not ideal in winter . When patrons open the door it\u2019s freezing .They won\u2019t let you sit in the back away from the door even if nobody is sitting at the much larger table . I used to love Bonchons, I started using uber eats to order. The first few times the chicken was cooked Golden Brown & Crispy, I ordered it again today thinking it would be better, The chicken strips were  very greasy and not fried well. To have it delivered was almost 50.00 dollars with tip. So sad, it was supposed to be my Sunday dinner, Never again.\u2639\ufe0f The food is fantastic. Sides, mains, everything was well cooked and seasoned.\nSadly, this restaurant needs a DEEP clean and left me concerned about the state of the back of house. The walls are grimy, the switch plates in the bathroom were stained with fingerprints, and my seat faced the attached view of fly encrusted cobwebs. Yikes. If they got the cleaning in order this would easily be a 5 star review I ordered drumsticks and bibimbap. I asked the server 2 times if there are side dishes with bibimbap, as in San Francisco, Seattle and Seoul I always get side dishes like kimchi, reddish etc. anyway, he lied. No side dishes and I\u2019ve been craving kimchi. I also don\u2019t like eggs done this way, if should be a whole egg. But egg is fine. As for chicken, crusty but it didn\u2019t feel like Korean bbq chicken. Maybe I\u2019m spoiled. Overall, it was fine. I wouldn\u2019t have even written anything. It\u2019s just I hate it when people lie to me unnecessarily I don\u2019t usually leave reviews, but this time I had to.\nAs an appliance technician, I visit a lot of commercial kitchens \u2014 and these guys have one of the cleanest and best-maintained kitchens I\u2019ve seen.\nThat\u2019s exactly what you want to see when you walk into a real restaurant.\nGreat management, too.\n\nP.S. I\u2019ll probably start leaving more reviews for places like this \u2014 because trust me, it\u2019s not common."

Not sure why they only have a 3.9 star rating because this place is 5 stars all around! Yeien was the kindest server and made this experience 10x better! Food was absolutely delicious!\nService was very good annd atmosphere was great! Was craving Mexican food after visiting the Rocky Mountain Arsenal National Park and was very excited to find El Patron nearby.\nLet me tell you, they have a lot of food options so be prepared to READ!\nFood portions are large, delicious, and authentic. Believe me as I lived in SoCal and glad I found this place to satisfy those cravings. After driving 9+ hours today it was such a treat to find this place.  My husband and I totally relied on the reviews from google because this is the first time we visit the Denver area.  We were not disappointed at all.  The food was great, the atmosphere and service the same and we didn\u2019t wait much to get our food.\nWe totally recommend El Patron Mexican Food"

    "reviews": "Im from Boston and love Dunkin but this Dunkin needs to work on EVERYTHING!! The employees can't figure out what your order even consists of and then they act like little snots with attitude problems when you try to correct them. The hash browns are never fully cooked which gets people sick!! There is a male manager who is more concerned with flirting with his employees rather than mixing coffee and making sure food is fully cooked. EVERY TIME he's there the food is 10x worse and it's already pretty bad normally. Their eggs are watery and runny, the coffee is always missing something you ask for and rarely mixed properly. Next time I get a frozen hash brown I'm calling the health inspector!! Nothing at this location is made with love \ud83d\ude2d I miss good Dunkin' Donuts. I was super excited to get the $6 breakfast + $2 donut holes! What a deal... EXCEPT that the donut holes seemed like they were a day or 2 old. They were dry, not soft and just not good at all. The breakfast was ok enough, but still...I probably won't rush over to get breakfast from here again. Sad I have only been to this location 3 times over 4 years and have never once had a good experience. The machines are always down and they take forever. I waited 25 minutes for 3 coffee drinks one time. This time they said their espresso machine has been down for a few days. How are you a coffee shop without an espresso machine for that long? Alandra, at Dunkin Donuts  on Green Valley Ranch and Tower was so snobby! She was rushing us and didn't want to add extra cream when I requested it, I dare not ask for more. Then she didn't respond when I asked for a receipt, and didn't want to give me her name. She was so mean and rude to us as customers, she had zero stars for her customer service skills!!She needs a lot of training on how to treat your paying loyal customers!!She made our experience very uncomfortable!! \ud83e\udd75 \ud83d\udc4e\ud83c\udffe My coffee drink was delicious, the store was clean, staff was friendly. I had an issue with a valid coupon scanning correctly and they were able to figure out how to fix it. Good coffee drinks and good donuts. What\u2019s not to love?"

    "reviews": "Very nice and clean and Anna was awesome she's the manager she needs a raise for how sanitary and clean she is and the food Establishment Wow this visit turned out to be about the restaurant not the food. This is the dirtiest fast food restaurant I have ever experienced. Which made my meal which was good but not so enjoyable. I thought Wendy's had high standards. Every table was dirty,  food on the floor everywhere. Cups and trash on the tables. It was at 5pm so not after a lunch rush. If this is what the front of the restaurant looks like, what's in the back? I don't think I want to know. I'm very disappointed. So I've been coming to this same wendys for 3yrs since I moved in green valley. Normally no complaints but the last 2 times the quality of food is beyond unsatisfactory.  Burger so old cheese is hard. Patty hard. This was my last visit and my last doller spent I haven't had this many sneaky attempts at upselling things since I went to a sketchy car dealership. The staff twice tried to add things to my check by being deceptive. They refused to give me a receipt. While nothing was wrong with the food itself, I felt like I was being scammed and I'm deeply uncomfortable with it. I went to Wendy\u2019s at six in the morning and it wasn\u2019t even open. They opened a little bit later I waited. I ordered me my breakfast meal And I got food poisoning after I ate that I had to go home from work early cause I was throwing up and stomach ache. Do not eat here very bad the french fries look old, but I was hungry so I ate it."

    "reviews": "Great Burger! Great salad! Stopped in for dinner on a Saturday night, it was busy but we got seats at the bar. Friendly bartenders and our order came out quick. Solid burger and good options for salads.. a little disappointed the $18 burger doesn't come with a side. Great selection of beer and a full bar! Our experience at this location was disappointing. Despite arriving when it wasn't busy, we waited 10 minutes to be seated. The wait staff was slow to take our drink orders, and our waitress wasn't friendly. However, the burgers were exceptional, cooked to just the way you want it. The bacon with steroids burger, featuring two patties and six slices of bacon, was a highlight and definitely worth trying. This place is delicious!\n\nWe\u2019ve been here a few times and they always cook our burgers perfectly. There creativity with the different burgers options are always good. We got their holiday special roast burger and it was insanely good. Definitely get it if you pop in while it\u2019s still around. The only thing we wish this place did differently was to include a side with your burger purchase.\n\nAlso, there shakes are SO GOOD. Never too watery and never too light like some other places.\n\nOur waitress was Victoria - she was fantastic. She\u2019s knowledgeable, kind, friendly, & thoughtful. Whatever they\u2019re paying her, it isn\u2019t enough.\n\nThe restaurant also has awesome charm and character. 10/10 recommend Customer service was excellent she was extremely nice and helpful and the food was also excellent the build your burger was great, we had the chicken strips with tater tots and onion rings which was a very good, the shakes we\u2019re fantastic and the atmosphere was enjoyable and kid friendly I would definitely recommend passing through if ever in Denver. The name might seem to be geared towards adults but it\u2019s definitely kid friendly. I love bad daddy burgers there pretty good for sure. The burgers are always hot and fresh. This building was clean and the employees were very friendly. I would highly recommend this place to anyone looking for a place to have a delicious burger. I will definitely be back here again. For sure...."

Went back again for dinner yesterday and holy SALTY!!\n\nCame with a party of 7. Got seated right away and service was pretty quick. We were charged $2.50 x 3 for chips and salsa which\u2026 you use to be able to eat it free and however much you want!!\n\nOrdered 2 smothered carne asada burrito ($12), kids hamburger ($7) and couldn\u2019t even be eaten because it tasted like they dumped the entire salt container!! Waiter took the plate and decided to order nothing more. Rest of table ordered carnitas plate ($19), chimichanga ($15) enchiladas ($17) beef taco with rice and beans and truly just mediocre. The roof was even leaking over our table from the snow! Definitely won\u2019t be back again.. yikes!! I ordered Menudo. There was a lot of broth but not enough Menudo and all the ingredients for this soup. The service was excellent\u2014one of the best in town! Otherwise, the items on the menu are very good! Did was good. Atmosphere was great! Place was cl an and service was great. No complaints. The skinny margarita was bomb! Went here for the very first time I will definitely be coming back. Everything was so fresh and absolutely delicious my husband had the posole and it by far was the best posole we've ever had! I got a combo and was able to make the combo whatever I wanted everything was beyond amazing \ud83d\ude0d State definitely found new customers that will be back many many many many many times! Also the servers and the staff there are so friendly and very helpful they made the experience even better! Hands down just found our new favorite place! Food is decent, but ordering to-go is a total rip off. Both dinners I ordered included neither rice nor beans (even though it was stated on the menu) plus no chips and salsa...never known a Mexican restaurant to be stingy with these side items...jus saying. When I called to ask why these things were left out, the woman answering the phone just acted like she didn't understand English. Save yourself the headache and just dine in if your in the mood for mediocre Mexican food."

    "reviews": "This neighborhood bar offers great drinks, delicious food, and a welcoming atmosphere. It's a place you'll find yourself coming back to time and time again, especially to see the warm and attractive bartenders ;}   Highly recommended! Great little neighborhood watering hole. PBR on tap is ice cold and the menu is actually top notch for bar grub. Friendly, warm staff. Great local vibes. Nice place to watch a game or have a small get together. The fried chicken sandwich wasn\u2019t what I expected for the typical bar Fried Chicken Sandwich. The sandwich at this place is more like a hot and spicy from McDonald but it costs 13 bucks definitely not worth that price. Other than that it\u2019s a cool neighborhood bar. Two weeks in a row I\u2019ve left without service. Last week there were no tables (it\u2019s a small place) and I was told I wasn\u2019t allowed to sit outside though it was sunny and warm, so I walked back home. This week I was asked to leave because I had my 5yo son with me and it was wing night. My son and I come here all the time for wing night, so often that he now associates Wednesday with wing night. I\u2019ve asked numerous times and they\u2019ve always happily welcomed us. But today we were asked to leave after waiting for a menu for 15 minutes. It wasn\u2019t busy, maybe half full. So my son got back on my shoulders and we walked back home. I reckon I won\u2019t be back even without my son after the past couple experiences. This is truly one of my favorite bar & restaurants in the area. It is really affordable and the staff is great. Most of the bartenders have been there for a long time which shows the owner takes care of his people. I've had a good chunk of their menu and it never fails to disappoint. Their wings are great, garlic buffalo is one of my favorite classic sauces, if you like extra hot, give the Fuego a try! Plus, they have handcut fries that you can get Cajun style and I am a huge fan. Can't go wrong with this spot, it is full of returning local for a reason!"

    "reviews": "A bit pricey when it is a automatic 20% charge on top of your bill. The food was great. Service a bit slow but drinks were great. Plenty of things to do outside and inside a wonderful fire feature. Add some ambience I wish the parking was a little bit more for the amount of people that can actually come to this place. Enjoyed it. It was clean when I was there. Green Valley Ranch Beer Garden is a cute spot! Just be prepared\u2014the food line can take a while depending on when you arrive, and it definitely gets busy, which usually means it\u2019s a good sign. The food itself took some time to come out, and the day I went, they were out of rice\u2014which was a bit disappointing, especially since I ordered a poke bowl. That said, the drinks were good, and most of the staff was friendly during our visit. The atmosphere is fun and casual, and I appreciated that they had heaters for some of the outdoor seating. It might not be my first choice next time, just because I\u2019d like to explore more of the area\u2014but overall, it\u2019s a cute spot to catch up with friends! We stopped by GVR Beer Garden for dinner after leaving the airport. The place was relatively busy, however we were able to order and get our food quickly.\n\nWe ordered, the Standard Burger,  Philly Cheese Steak, and several appetizers, Tater Tots and Fried Pickles. The Burger and Cheese Steak were very delicious \ud83d\ude0b. However,  the appetizers were very salty. \ud83d\ude14\n\nWe ordered several draft \ud83c\udf7b which were very refreshing.\n\nWe like the atmosphere and the overall concept with the awesome indoor outdoor seating.  They also had live entertainment during our visit. However,  it's extremely inconvenient to have to order food and alcohol at separate locations and pay for them separately.\n\nOverall it was a pleasant experience. Really enjoyed the atmosphere and food. Especially enjoyed the cheese curds and fries, though I did not super love the braised beef sandwich. Also had a great selection on tap. This is a great place for drinks and playing games with friends and family. I was impressed by their selection of beers and cocktails and their interior seating space is a laid back. This combined with a fun outdoor space with several cornhole sets and outdoor seating, this is a really fun spot that is definitely family friendly. The bar staff was extremely nice and attentive. Really loved this as a fun laid back spot to spend our afternoon."

Everybody is just hostage in the line. And nobody has the brains to come out and move traffic around so people can leave. What I enjoyed...the food was hot. I recommend the cod dinner and the chicken strips. The fries were hot and good as well. The team was very pleasant and professional. The tables were cleared and clean. The restroom was decent. The only issues, they didn't add my condiments to the burger (maybe I was supposed to get my own). I ordered a double, and the patties are very smashed. I ordered a double-scoop of the custard. Looking at the picture on the brochure, if that is 1 scoop, I definitely did not get that either. To their credit, it was deliciously smooth and creamy and flavorful. I didn't complain about the portion to the team because it got really busy, and it wasn't a deal breaker. Will I go back, maybe in a couple of months, because of the distance. I was not enamored by the Butterburger. Maybe cause I got a single instead of a double but the ratio of patty to vegetables and bun was off. Cheese curds were okay and the fish and chips I got for takeout were good, not spectacular but still solid.\n\nFood came out quickly though and the staff were pleasant to interact with though. Dec 2024\nChristmas Eve to-go and had the luck to be in Angela's line at the counter.\n\nAfter maaany visits here, I was surprised to be asked if I was a senior citizen (no, don't get me wrong....lol), I actually thought she was asking if I was a \"singer\"...\ud83e\udd2d... then realized \"senior\", and had to say, yes(!), proudly! \ud83d\ude09\nAnyway, I got a 5% discount!  As I have said, am here very often and never knew about it.\nAngela, I appreciate your going beyond but, what I appreciate more is how warm and welcoming you made a customer like me feel.  5-\u2b50 customer service!\n\nBTW, this time, I got to try the Reuben Sandwich and will be adding that to our list of favorites which includes, the Cod Fish Dinner,  Mushroom and Swiss sandwich and their Shrimp!\n\nOriginal Review :\n--------------------------\n2nd day of operation, this was a Friday.\nWent for takeout at a little past 2 pm and drive through was about 7 cars long when I went in and still had cars lined went I came out.\n\nConsidering it was 2pm, the restaurant was about near full and there were constant in and out customers.\n\nGot my favorite Mushroom and Swiss to-go and the day's Really Reese's ice cream.\n\nThe wait for my takeout was about 15 minutes, but, could be forgiven as growing pains coupled with high volume customers.\n\nThe restaurant is exactly the Culver's look except smaller than the other one on Buckley Rd..\n\nService was \ud83d\udc4d, as I have expected and experienced from Culver's.\nHope this continues just like how service has always been top-notch in the other Buckley branch.\n\nThank you, Culver's for shortening my drive to have your delicious food. \ud83c\udf54 Our first time at Culver\u2019s! The kids had kids meal and they had free ice cream - what a treat! The burgers are delish! \ud83e\udd70 People are kind and Friendly!"

The food tasted pretty good, especially the burgers, although I thought the fries had a kind of strange taste, like maybe the oil needed to be changed.\nThe ordering process was ok, she seemed to have some trouble with that we were trying to order, but wasn't very inconvenient.\nOverall, fairly quick and we got our food in separate bags inside of another bigger bag, which was nice. The food was pretty good. Pathetic service. Order 2 chicken sandwiches. No cars in line. Still waiting 10 minutes as other cars pull up and get foood.\n\nLike either say the chicken will take a while or have me order something else. Lazy night crew needs to stop smoking the weed.\n\nWhat fast food place cant make 2 sandwiches? This was by far the WORST experience I've ever had at a Wendy's ever. The lady who took the order was very rude and blunt, the person who took our payment didn't confirm the order and only said \"have a good night\" then shut the window quickly, then when we got handed our food everything was there but the lady basically shoved our food in the car and then gave us our drinks (two doctor peppers and a sprite) you can see below the two doctor peppers were completely different in color and we confirmed it was doctor peppers they said yes then shut the window and laughed historically at us as we left the parking lot. We will NOT be going back in the evening. We asked her if she could speak to us in Spanish since we only spoke Spanish and she treated us terribly... She was rude and reluctant, what a bad experience. I took today What a shame that there are people who have such attitudes towards other people... Because we did not know how to speak English we were treated badly for 3 simple hamburgers, 3 soft drinks and 3 French fries. I charge $37.77 My family and I decided to go to Wendy's for dinner tonight. We ordered 3 large, Mills. Food is not fresh missing. A fry, missing a sandwich.. I didn't Really want to stop at Wendy's cause. Her normal restaurant was closed. This is exactly why we stopped eating it out. It cost $50 for a family of 3 to eat out. The food is cold not fresh. When I told them about the missing food? And handed the bag back to them. They had to check it. Turns out that they were missing the food. But yet all these fast food workers want twenty dollars an hour when they can't even get a order, right."

I had to tell the kid to get me a new salsa. \ud83e\udd2c The quality of the ingredients has gotten better over the years.

    "reviews": "We sat at the bar and had fantastic service. We really enjoyed watching Tristan and Matt make drinks all night. They were attentive to our needs and had great suggestions. I mean just look at these drinks, their attention to detail is beautiful! They also gave us some recommendations being that we are out of towners. Excellent craft cocktails, delicious food, lovely bartenders. My partner and I shared the Ni\u00e7oise Salad and Nashville Hot Chicken Sandwich, both were very good. For drinks I had the Lavender Greyhound and Pennyroyal Tea, and I would highly recommend both.  My partner had the Mable Gramm and the Smoke & Mirrors. This place is a must visit in Arvada! My only sadness is we came in on a week night so we could not check out the speakeasy! Been a few times, really tried to like it but I really don't think the quality of the food matches the price.  The service and the location are great, no complaints there.  Drinks are good, but priced high.  The food is fine, but for what you're paying it's not great and kind of bland unfortunately.  2 people, 2 drinks each and 2 mains ~$160 after tip Awesome vibey little bar with phenomenal cocktails and food. Deserves a 5 star rating, and y'all that aren't giving it that are fools.\n\nPersonally had the Smoke & Mirrors and the Mable Gramm cocktails. Rye cocktails that were both amazing in their own right, but I couldn't suggest the Smoke & Mirrors more to anyone who loves whiskey and smoke with a flair for performance (not usually my thing, but trust me). My partner had that Lavender Greyhound and the Pennyroyal Tea. Both fantastic, but I was mostly jealous of the Lavender Greyhound.\n\nNicoise Salmon salad was excellent. The salmon was crispy and a tad salty, but the mild flavors of the salad together with the salty salmon were fantastic.\n\nThe Nashville \"Hot\" Chicken Sandwich was exactly what I wanted. I love a crispy chicken sandwich, and my issue with most Nashville Hot Chicken Sandwiches is that you just taste the heat. This sandwich was perfection. Just a hint of heat on a perfectly cooked crispy chicken patty. Shoestring potatoes were super crispy and flavorful.\n\nOnly got a picture of the Mable Gramm cocktail. I don't always review, but this place definitely deserves a 5 star rating. Service, drinks, food, all 5 stars. Tristan and his partner at the bar were killing it and the kitchen was on fire! Hitting on all cylinders tonight.\nUpdate: just came through again.four months later. This visit had Matt and Chris behind the bar. This spot never disappoints. They crushed some amazing craft cocktails for us, coupled with outstanding service and a few laughs for good measure.Tried Matt\u2019s Seasonal creation and it was silky smooth."

This is absolutely the spot to come to if you're looking for good bar energy. Andrea took care of us and was an amazing server. We ordered a lot of food and idk how she remembered all of it without writing it down. Everything was delicious!! Lots of seating booths + hightops and they do have 2 pool tables. A t.v. everywhere you look so good for whatching everything at the same time. I was most surprised on the price on drinks because my tab was way lower than most other places for the same things. They have lots of happy hour deals too!! Definitely stop by here if you have a chance or are just looking for some comfort food. We love coming here! It feels like family. The service is amazing. Food is fantastic. We love to come in to see the bar tender Jordan! She is our favorite. She\u2019s so welcoming and fun! Definitely check them out! Great place to watch sports especially hockey.  Pizza is good. Place can get packed. What a great place this is!  We love coming here!  The food is good, the atmosphere is great, and the employees are the BEST!

We've been here about three times and each time it has been mediocre. Sports bar atmosphere and I'm sure most people come in because it's in Olde Town but I don't think we'll be back. In the last 6 or 7 months we've been in this area, we've watched the prices rise to $20 per entree here. A 'tin cup' of fries has increased to $10. Other appetizers are even more expensive. I ordered a well-done roasted poblano burger with mango salsa and it came out medium rare and their brioche buns are regularly dry as can be. Usually makes the burgers seem bland. Service seemed great until after we ordered. Someone else brought our food out and our waiter never came back to check on us until after we were mostly done eating. Too late for me to tell him about the burger. We've definitely tried to give this place a chance but have decided we will not return since a basic meal that is bland cost nearly $50 with lackluster service.\nAlso don't care for just including plastic straws with all drinks even when not requested, especially since people handle them with bare hands. We showed up with a party. Granted it was decently big. Service was terribly slow. It was a solid 20 minutes before even drinks came out. Another half hour before food started to come out. It came out so slowly that people were done eating before someone else at the same table even got their food. I got the fish and chips, fish was dry and bland. Cole slaw was so salty it was inedible. My wife got a sandwich that fell apart on soggy bread and was bland. Multiple people said they would come refill our waters and just never came back. Got offered malt vinegar and didn\u2019t see that server for another half hour and she came back empty handed. They weren\u2019t even busy. Absolutely terrible service. Terrible food that was overpriced. I usually give places 2 chances before leaving a review but I will never come back here. Stay away. Regretful to say, but this place isn\u2019t going to be on our list of bars to visit in Olde Town anymore.\n\nFood prices have gone way up, as other reviews have stated, a small side of fries is $10 and mediocre burgers are $20. We have been in before and at least enjoyed the food, but on our most recent visit it was awful. An incredibly dry burger and I was given a salad that was supposed to be a Caesar but it was tiny and had no dressing. Our waitress was kind and attentive, but service can\u2019t withstand the rising prices and poor food."

    "reviews": "We ordered everything on the happy hour menu\u2014and it was all fantastic! Every item was delicious and clearly made with care. The staff was outstanding: friendly, attentive, and made us feel genuinely welcome. You can tell the management runs a tight, thoughtful ship. Great food, great service, great atmosphere. I\u2019ll definitely be back! Rather disappointing considering the existing reviews.  The food was mediocre at best, the service was acceptable, but not great.  The iced tea was incredibly weak and bland, barely stronger than water (the photos show a cola, but not the iced tea, you'll have to trust me on this); the chicken in the chicken parmesan was fine, but the pasta lacked flavor, the gluten-free pizza was oily and had very little toppings, the rustic ranger pizza was okay.  Overall, I'd skip this place and try somewhere else; Tap and Dough was a swing and a miss for us. Our first time at this location! The happy hour menu is incredible, we literally ordered one of everything. Our server Robin was very friendly, attentive and professional. The GM Micah came out to make sure everything was phenomenal as well and told us about the Second Saturday concerts! We will be back! Was very disappointed in our experience. Menu and photos of the food looked good but no one in our group loved what they ordered. We weren\u2019t greeted by our waiter for 15 minutes which was frustrating. The cocktail I ordered was really bad (some tequila drink). Waiter took it off the bill which was nice but when he cleared the drink, he stood there and took a sip to test it out I guess? Really unprofessional. Ordered the Caesar and two pastas. The baked bolognese was pretty good but the chicken parm was average. Sad when the highlight of the meal was a basic Caesar. Don\u2019t think we\u2019ll be going back. Mostly because of the service. Great location. Great selection of beer. Friendly service. Easy menu. Pizza is good. Pasta dishes are good. Italian wings are very good. With pepperoni, peppers, and marinara sauce for dipping sauce. Great vibes. Lots of tv\u2019s for sports entertainment."

    "reviews": "We walked by this place a few weeks ago and made a mental note to check back in. I'm glad we did! Great menu, fantastic cocktails, and friendly service. Cute back patio that they extended. Can't wait to go back for dinner. We are so so happy we decided to check Table out! It is so great to have this kind of place in Olde Town with their locally sourced farm to table concept, and the food has been phenomenal both times we have gone! Service was also really great. The burrata, mushroom pasta, and tofu steaks are standouts in my mind, but really I haven't had a bad bite. And oh man, don't get me started on the fresh bread...I just went on Tuesday and already thinking about when I can go back! I was pleasantly surprised over how much we enjoyed the new food! From the house made focaccia, cucumber salad with black garlic molasses, to the pork chop, and lobster ravioli, everything was incredible! Desserts were great too. Staff was friendly, efficient and I like that the atmosphere isn\u2019t stuffy. The prices are fantastic for the quality and portions. Can\u2019t wait to go back and try Fall menu. New Image was packed on this Wednesday night in June. The rain made the outside seating unavailable. We showed up at 6:30 with 2 adults and 2 kids and there was not a table in sight. Ordered food and beers with the hopes that a table would open up, but as our burgers were ready it was apparent there was no place for us to sit, we were fully prepared to take our food to go and eat it at home. The staff was incredible- they acknowledged they were packed, offered to pack our food up to go, but also offered to find us a table and make sure we were able to enjoy our burgers there. They navigated the insane dining room to find us a table, made sure our food stayed hot in the process, and checked on us to make sure we were having a positive experience. This situation could have easily turned out poorly, but the staff at new image this evening did everything in their power to make this a positive experience.\n\nThe burgers are to die for. The Wednesday deal of a burger and beer for $10 is the best in town. Our group tried many dishes off the menu: bread and butter, gnocchi, duck liver, kids chicken fingers, chicken sausage, pork chop, and the mushroom spaghetti.\n\nOf those dishes these were the winners:\nBread and butter\nSpaghetti\nPork chop\n\nThe kids did not like the chicken tenders.\n\nWhile we enjoyed trying something new, we left feeling like the appetizers mostly missed the mark and the menu was largely overpriced.\n\nI understand that some menu items will be higher cost because of the farm to market sourcing and the need to compensate staff well. Some things I can\u2019t reconcile are $9 bread, $5 for a small glass of kids milk, and $15 for a glass of wine (at a brewery).\n\nOur service was exceptional and you can tell the staff is excited and passionate about their food.\nWe were the first ones to try the duck liver and the kitchen gave us a free round for our feedback.\n\nAfter our meal, I\u2019d give a 3.5 to the food and 4.5 for service. The new menu has a lot of potential and I\u2019d be curious to see how it evolves over time."

Had a great experience. Darien was amazing. He gave us the best customer service 10 out of 10 recommend this location is one of my favorites Great location, decent service and a great happy hour. Also some great seasonal specials! My sweet kids brought me here on valentine's day.  It was delicious I've been coming here for years. Never had a bad experience. Went in a little late last night and thought they may have been closed. You could tell they had had a busy night, and I was expecting a kind of worn-out atmosphere.  Idk who was the chef last night, but the appetizers and the main course were hands down the best flavor I've ever tasted from any Applebee's in the country. Management, if you see this, give that man a raise. My server was a young woman named Kat who was equal to the chef. Every time I thought to myself, I wish I knew where she was, she showed up early. All around a memorable experience that you just don't get very often. Kudos to management and highest praise for the team at this Applebee's. If Google gives out the best eatery rewards, Applebee's should win the top 5 spots."

The back patio is really nice too. Definitely my favorite dive. Check them out! I know you'll be back again. It\u2019s a dive - but that is a good thing! Great local place. The food is fresh. They make a mean Philly Cheesesteak. The hand cut fries were done right. Very friendly staff. Fun place to hang out. Fun Wednesday night bluegrass! Steff the bartender made me feel safe and welcome as a solo woman. She was cool! Great neighborhood dive - and that's with absolute affection.  Stephanie was a doll, and it's obvious that she truly cares about her customers.  The Philly Cheese Steak is just awesome!   It's a no frills, down home great place.  The regulars are even welcoming.  Definitely will be back! I mostly come here for free poker.  The service is great and the prices are awesome.   I don't eat when I drink, but people always order food here.  It's a small establishment but the people are always friendly and I enjoy myself when I'm here.

We started off with duck cheese wantons. Then we had the panang curry and yellow curry. The panang was super spicy and the yellow curry had a hint of spiciness. Both were super delicious. We wound up taking half of it home, because the portions were so generous.\n\nBut we did have fried ice cream for dessert and we were blown away. It was sooooo good. I think about it often.\n\nThe staff was also great and the food came out quickly. I got the tom yummy seafood ramen and i gotta say it's interesting fusion between Japanese and Thai style the noddle were perfect the broth was good and their thai ice tea is spot on. Will be back again for sure a hidden gem in Arvada. The food was amazing! The only thing I didn't care much for was the bright lighting for the evening dinner time. The atmosphere could be easily improved with some softer lighting. Also, maybe a booth or two would be nice. Delicious food and great menu option! Perfect for a cold night. Ramen was filling and had delicious flavor. This building doesn\u2019t look great from the outside but the inside is fine/clean. The food was delicious and fresh. Seaweed salad was very good and a little sweet. Dumplings were good. You can build your own ramen\u2026. Pick noodles, pick broth, pick protein. I loved my green curry! They have outside seating"

    "reviews": "We got the double cod fish and chips plus a cup of clam chowder. This was plenty of food for 2 people, and it was tasty. This is our second time as we visited last year. We were happy to see that the food was just as good. GB is my go to fish and chips in the Denver area.\n\nFood is always amazing and be sure to get an order of curry to dip your fries in. It\u2019s life changing!\n\nThis location has the best atmosphere and even has a covered outdoor seating area as well as a traditional patio. I always love the food at any GB fish and chips location. And the folks behind the counter here are always friendly. But what makes this particular location stand out is the outdoor seating, with plenty of room, and space for kids to play.  It is one of our go to places to bring the kids on a warm evening. Best fish and chips I've found in Colorado! The chicken curry pastie was excellent too. Great spot near Old Town Arvada, super clean, comfortable, nice atmosphere and the employees were very friendly and seemed happy to be there. The only negative I can say is that the foot rest on the high bar inside is broken. We plan on going back the next time we're in the area! Really straightforward, good English style beer battered fish and chips. Great steak fries (crispy but not burnt!). Generous portions - I thought the 1/2 size wouldnt be enough but I barely finished 4/6 pieces from my full order of cod and chips. Prawns are solid, sausage roll was super tasty. Mashed potatoes are good as well - well seasoned. Wish we had this back home"

Apparently, the Chai milk stout is a big hit. Plus, they have a decent happy hour, so that's a bonus Buffet or ala carte.  Buffet selection was limits to curry and Indian dishes. Ample salad bar and dessert.  Ala carte portions were generous.  Service was great.  Reservations recommended as seating was limited. I stopped by the Yak and Yeti Restaurant and Brewpub for a local brew. I had the jalapeno ale, which was quite good. Then they gave me an appetizer, which was a nice surprise. Overall, this is a really cool place to enjoy a brew. I got the lunch buffet. $14 per person, they give you water and lemons for free. It's super filling and delicious, I'd have loved to have more but I was STUFFED!\n\nThe indoor atmosphere felt like a big house. It felt very welcoming. I had a great time coming here Such a yummy place to eat! They have a super buffet. Great for this vegetarian."

    "reviews": "Went here for dinner and enjoyed their commitment to the school theme while still serving great food and drinks. The customizable mac n cheese and the chicken fried steak were large portions and tasted good. They have a huge selection of whiskeys and wide range of craft beers too. Service was fast and the prices didn\u2019t feel like we paid a premium for the gimmick, definitely worth a visit. Really amazing building with so much character! So cool to be in a building with over 100 years of history that has been well taken care of. As far as food and drinks go it was interesting\u2026 martinis came in beer glasses and seemed like small portions. Old fashioned also came in one of their beakers and seemed like a not so generous portion. Might have just been optics but just something to keep in mind. We ordered the machine nachos and they had a lot of barbecue sauce which is clearly stated in the menu but was still an interesting choice. Overall, maybe I just need to try different menu items but had a good time in the building regardless. This was the coolest restaurant! I absolutely loved the vibe they had going on. From our Luke warm welcome when we were handed menus and told to find a seat the entire experience was odd. The waitress/bartender took forever to take our order and didn\u2019t appear to be too busy. The blackened salmon was fine but the French onion soup was honestly the best I\u2019ve ever had. A good server can make an okay meal great, a okay server makes an okay meal sub-par. I'm in search of the perfect Reuben. This one scores a 9.5! The potatoe tots were the perfect combination of soft, crispy, and salty. The French dip was fantastic and so was a salmon. Great atmosphere was the perfect edition. Great building/ decor.  It's the place to go if you want an alcoholic beverage (2000 whiskies, lots of beer on tap).  Food and service can be hit or miss ( depending on how busy they are).  I had a delicious burger ( queso burger)."

Probably the best burger I've had in Colorado!!! The holiday special with bacon jam and goat cheese was amazing! Awesome fries! And great dipping sauces!! What could make this place better? Nothing because it's located inside a brewery! Great local place with solid beer and food.   The burgers were spot on and very tasty!   Simple and well executed.   The atmosphere is lively and festive...makes you feel like  your a part of community.\n\nCan't wait to go back and spend more time on the patio with more food and beer I had the mighty bacon burger with tots and fries.  Went on trivia night and it was great to see all of the well behaved dogs and everyone seemed to have a great time. The burgers here are the best we have had here in Colorado! They were cooked to a perfect medium rare. The flavor was out of this world good! Josh was VERY attentive and proud of the product he cooked. The fries were great! We also had the fried beer cheese. All I can say is WOW!. Being tied in with the Denver Beer Company is just an added benefit. If you haven't had their Graham Cracker Porter you have missed out. The service was great, the food was great, and the beer was great! The only down side is the parking."

Great atmosphere, friendly staff. Cool environment. Definitely found my new sandwich joint! Great sandwhich shop in Olde Town Arvada. Mainly only a sanwhich and quesadilla place but they do offer a small bar to sit at for beer and cocktails. No meatball grinders but the Red Eye Special was pretty good. I was hungry for a good Reuben and searched for one nearby.

I've been a proud Mug Club member since I moved here several years ago, and it truly feels like home.\n\nThe atmosphere is always fun, welcoming, and full of friendly faces (and adorable dogs!). The beer lineup is consistently fantastic, and I love that Odyssey also gives back to the community--just another reason to love them even more.\n\nOne thing that really sets Odyssey apart? It's a kid-free brewery. As someone who values a peaceful pint, I appreciate having a spot where adults can unwind, connect, and enjoy themselves without the background noise of a daycare. Parents deserve a break, and hey, some of us don't have kids at all!\n\nIf you're looking for amazing beer, great vibes, and an awesome community, Odyssey is the place to be. Highly recommend! Found this taproom on Google Maps, and clicked the events tab. They had an ice cream truck today. My son has wanted to go to his first ice cream truck for a while now. When we arrived and purchased a child sized chocolate ice cream for him and I bought a beer, there was a large group of people by the entrance (because it was the twelfth anniversary party) and they were standing in front of a sign. Once we sat down to enjoy our Friday treats, the people moved, and I could see the sign about 21+ applying even to the picnic table we sat at next to the ice cream truck. I finished my beer as quickly as was reasonable, while my son ate his ice cream quietly. Once I had finished and he had a large cup of melted chocolate ice cream, we were aggressively told to leave. Even if we were welcome, I'll never come back.\n\nThanks for responding. Your framing is a classic non apology. After my experience, I visited your website and saw the many ways you make it clear that children are not welcome at your establishment. Your reply glosses over the fact that your events page isn't one of those.\n\nAgain: I will never return with or without my son, and you can continue to pat yourself on the back for being pro-adult, but it wouldn't hurt to have a laugh and be able to say sorry one time. Totally forgot to leave a review when we visited a month ago, oops! Every single beer we\u2019ve had here is great, and love the atmosphere. The absolute PLUS is there are no kids, we lovvvve it \ud83e\ude75 Also- dog friendly, (6!) beers in a flight, and all the staff are so helpful and personable! This brewery isn't just a place to drink some beer, it's a place to drink great beer. I was once a regular, but I stopped visiting when I retired. I recently visited again after a 4-year hiatus and I'm still impressed with how great their beer is. Great spot!!!  Food truck schedule, great beers, great events!   Will be back again soon.   I would love to explore more of the fun here!"

We also had the Chicken Korma , saag paneer and Dal Makhani. Flavors were fine but not our favorite. We went around 5:45pm on a weekday and it was not crowded. In town for a few days staying at a nearby hotel and needed to charge my Turo Tesla. 30 feet away was this gem. I'm from North NJ, we have a lot of very good Indian food there. But this was better than anything I've had in NYC / NJ. Had the lamb vindaloo. It was perfect. Spiced perfectly as well. The garlic naan was delicious. So flavorful, not too thick.\n\nTo top it all off, the price was 2/3 of what I'd pay back home. 6 stars. Fantastic food, fantastic service, and the prices are amazing. It's rare I take a bite and go, \"Whoa,\" but here we are.\n\nFood is great, and the portions are almost share-plate sized. great service, good feng shui, real plants\n\ndinner date tonight with my mom, I ordered the butter chicken (under specialties on the second page) no spice with a side of garlic naan. My mom ordered spicy chicken biryani and we also shared an order of the meat samosas.\n\nSuch good food and a super dope dinner experience!!\n\n100% recommend :) FOOD WAS EXCEPTIONAL!!! Service was great! Our favorites were the Shrimp Coconut Curry, Chicken Tikka Masala, Jalape\u00f1o Garlic Cheese Naan. We ordered everything \u201cmedium\u201d for spiciness, it was zesty with great flavors! We drove all the way from Brighton to try this place out and it was so worth it!"

Hostess doing good job keeping the flow given limited spaces.\n\nThe place is very good at making extra by have other companies sign lining between seating area.\n\nServing staffs are very friendly and keeping track of orders despite the full house with more waiting. SaltGrass need to learn more from here.\n\nRib was good and indeed falling off the bone and not dry. Salad also done well.\n\nPrime rib is a bit too light on the favor (not soaked into beef, rely on the Au jus to make up.) and fattier cut than what we usually had. Steak cook temp to bit over, SaltGrass is better in control on how it's cooked. Very impressed. We put ourselves on the waiting list, and when we got to the door, we had a 5 minute wait. It's already off to a good start. We were taken to our table by a friendly hostess, and then our awesome server Ian welcomed us with perfect customer service. Then, shortly after, the manager came over and provided some upcoming updates and a coupon for our next visit. Then there's the food, the buns are dangerously good, we ordered the combo appetizers, the steak kebab and the 6oz filet. Everything was cooked to perfection. We will definitely return, and I highly suggest giving them a shot! I have never had such an amazing experience at a restaurant as I did here at Texas Roadhouse in Arvada. Not only was the service fast and kind, but the food was fresh, and it tasted amazing. I appreciate the manager, Chelsea, coming over and greeting us. The whole team went above and beyond. We will definitely be coming back. Love Texas roadhouse it can sometimes be a little loud in there but we always have a wonderful experience. Our favorite waiter is stephen Although we were originally told 30 minutes for a table we waited an hour.\nWe even used the call ahead feature.\n\nWe waited quite some time for our food too.\n\nIt may have been an off night, lots of items were over cooked and\n\nThe steak was tough, dry and difficult to eat.\nThe house salad didn\u2019t have any croutons but they were so busy, I couldn\u2019t get my severs attention, so it was consumed as is.\nThe loaded baked potatoes was burnt, dry and missing the bacon bits, I had to wait for those and my food was cold by then so it didn\u2019t mix as well together\nThe sweet potatoes was also burnt.\n\nThey offered to take the food back and remake it.\nWe didn\u2019t want wait again for items to be remade since we declined."

    "reviews": "McCoy\u2019s Restaurant has a cozy old-school diner feel that\u2019s really welcoming. The server was friendly and made the experience enjoyable. The portions are huge.  We had an egg white omelette that was just right, a big, soft cinnamon roll, and some fluffy pancakes. Great place for a breakfast and a relaxed atmosphere. Food was eh, My tacos were extremely greasy!! They were dripping like a Kitchen faucet, the consume was more like a bowl of grease with beef flavoring. The onions served were bad and tasted awful.  Not really thrilled, the Waiter was ok and the atmosphere was calm and Decent. I give this place a 3 out of 5. Food was great as always.  Soni was our waitress, and she had all the traits of an expert in her job.  She didn't pressure us about getting our order, but when we were ready, she was right there at exactly the right time.  She made sure that our breakfast experience was awesome.  This was the first time my girlfriend had eaten at McCoy's, and she loved everything about it! Great local spot. It was my first time there, having passed by it for years.  I took my daughter there for a quick Sunday brunch, and it was great!  We shared a chocolate milkshake, and it was delicious.   I had an omelet that was good, and my daughter's pancakes, she said, were also pretty good.\n\nWe will definitely be back with the rest of the family to try more! How to leave this review as it is a tough one.\n\nService was horrible. We got there at 710, ordered at 730, and received food at 820.\n\nWe ordered a cheese burger and fries,  kids hamburger,  chicken fried steak with pancakes and hashbrowns, and lastly, a French dip.\n\nChicken fried steak and French dip were decent.\n\nThe cheeseburger was not edible it was hard and burnt.\n\nThe kids' burger was better, but it's still not great.\n\nI have to give a 1 star for food and service.\n\nYou can't call yourself a diner and not be able to send out consistent burgers. BK shares the parking lot, and the burgers are better if that is what you are after.\n\nService needs major improvement as well."

    "reviews": "Such a cool little place in an interesting location. Nestled between some industrial parks is this quaint little brew pub where you can pour your own beers! Although I wouldn't exactly describe it that way since they don't brew their own beers. Hopefully one day in the future they can work on some small batch brews or partner with some nearby breweries. At least to get the Mich Ultra off the pour taps.\n\nThe food menu might be a bit small but the food is fantastic. The chips and salsa are home made and come with a red and a green salsa. It pairs well with the Build Your Own Burrito and won't cost you an arm and leg! Looking forward to seeing how this place grows! **Boombox Brew Bar - 5/5 Stars**\n\nBoombox Brew Bar is an absolute gem and exceeded all of my expectations!\n\n**Food (5/5):** The food here is simply amazing, especially for a bar! From the appetizers to the main courses, everything was prepared with care and packed with flavor. It\u2019s rare to find bar food this good, but Boombox Brew Bar has set a new standard.\n\n**Service (5/5):** The service was top-notch. The staff was friendly, attentive, and made sure we were well taken care of throughout the night. They were quick with the orders and always made us feel welcome.\n\n**Atmosphere (5/5):** The vibe at Boombox Brew Bar is fantastic. The music was lovely and really set the tone for a great evening. The atmosphere is relaxed but lively, making it perfect for a night out with friends or just enjoying a casual evening.\n\n**Drinks:** The drink specials were awesome, and the overall drink selection was impressive. Whether you're into craft beers, cocktails, or something in between, there\u2019s something for everyone here.\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for a place with great food, excellent service, and a fun atmosphere, Boombox Brew Bar is a must-visit. I\u2019ll definitely be coming back for more! Low key place, Definitely worth checking out if you haven\u2019t been here!! Awesome patio in the back with a fire pit, friendly staff. Most important, good selection of beers/cocktails/ciders etc. Pour yourself as little or as much as you want! Glasses stored in a fridge, different sizes, ready to go!! They do serve food, although  I\u2019ve only tried their drink selection wall. Friends threw a birthday party here last night. The spot is small but very open & have a great patio.\n\nI have no clue what the bartenders name was but my friend & I ordered a can drink/beer wall drink. The guy was super helpful on how it worked, walked me over there.\n\nI paid for the drinks and didn't think about it at the time but I didn't sign anything. I asked my friend how much the total was as I didn't know what was on the card. Checked my bank account and I basically was charged for the white claw, add 2$ for tax (??).\n\nI work in service industry and would never go anywhere I can't leave a tip. Just wanted to say thank you for being an awesome bartender and I hope to be able to come back sometime and actually tip you. Sending you karmic good vibes till then because that was the cheapest twb I've ever had & as I said feel bad for not being present when I was paying to not notice I didn't sign anything or tip\n\nSo thank you! a great place for lunch, dinner, or general partying.\n\nthe food and drinks are so good. super friendly service. all the owners are really nice and down to earth. the authentic new mexico cuisine is very much needed in denver metro. they have dark red chile, and green chile that is chile forward instead of being a chunks of pork gravy (colo style). all their enchiladas, burgers, burritos, are so tasty. their menu is pretty epic with chimichangas, chile cheese fries, chile pies, sopapillas, chile rellenos, and other new mexican treats\n\nthey have a beer wall with 18 beers and one cider (thank goodness!) on tap. we serve ourselves and the prices are quite reasonable all around. fridays are First Shot Free. they have a super nice patio. a bunch of TVs for sports and funny videos while good music is playing overhead"

As for the food, the fries were as limp as they could possibly be, and the frosty was chocolate and same as always. The bacon double cheeseburgers were just warm and didn't appear to be freshly made. , I had a great experience at Wendy's on 5775 Logan St, Denver, thanks to Alejandro, the manager. I had mistakenly ordered the wrong item, and when I called, he handled the situation with professionalism and kindness. He quickly replaced my order with the one I originally wanted, making sure I was satisfied. Excellent customer service and a great team! Thank you, Alejandro\ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udfff\n-Habtex I had the BEST fried chicken sandwich here! For fast food that is... I make a crazy good sandwich myself but this one did the trick on the road! Orders always correct. Food always fresh. I forgot to ask for spicy nuggets and asked at the window and they corrected the order and let me keep the extra nuggets. Great location Cashier Alejandro rung up everything wrong, but I got the right items. Was a 20 cent price difference... but doesn't make sense why you can't just ring up the right order?  Very odd, I would triple check receipts here. He seemed pissed I asked for one... well this explains why LOL"

    "reviews": "This place does not disappoint. The veggie pho was not only delicious but so generous with veggies and tofu. So often you get 3 slices of tofu and 4 slices of carrot but these guys give you an entire salad and so much Thai basil and bean sprouts too. If you\u2019re on the anti-microplastics train, ask them to bring your own container for the broth so they can fill that instead of the plastic container. Cute enough inside too that I kind of regretted doing takeaway. Been coming here for 2 years because this place has awesome broth & pho - but they recently changed their take out broth bowl size to 1 very small size that requires extra dishes to be used to pour out some broth, place ingredients in, and actually be able to eat without much spillage. I\u2019ve tried both the medium and large - to which the portions appear the same. Please bring back your larger sized broth bowls!!! Stopped in here because my daughter wanted to grab a bite after soccer practice.  We had never been before.  I was more than pleased with everything. The food was great.  Service was very friendly.  We will be going back.  I need to expand on the menu and see how good the pho is. Demolished this kid size pho bowl. No words can describe the joyful feeling I experienced. Will forever hold to the fact that this is indeed the best pho restaurant ever. Atmosphere is average, service is great, pho is the best I've tried in the Denver area. Found this place when it was on my way to work. We have since moved to Eastern Colorado. Pho 65 is now about an hour away. We still make the trip (passing SEVERAL other pho's) at least once a month in addition to getting 2 days worth anytime we have an errand to run anywhere near that area. Truly our favorite."

They do not disappoint and I always enjoy the treat of coming to this location. Especially the morning staff, you are doing great work!! Keep it up! \ud83e\udd70 Diana was amazing customer service was awesome the food was fresh and hot the dining room was very clean everybody was very friendly overall I would give six stars if I could fast fresh and friendly and right now they have boo bucks This is my last time visiting Wendy's.  I had a number one burger. The meet was cold and dry, the fries were not fresh. My last two experiences at different Wendy's were similar. Their motto of \"fresh\" is no longer true. I had food poisoning after eating half of my meal. I was sick for two days. There is something seriously off about this chain. I will not be returning. Heather is a very nice lady and took care of all of my needs. Jane was also very nice and understanding. Food is way better at this location than at others fries seem to be always fresh. Will come again. We love this Wendy's!   Friendly gal named Heather remembers us and gets our order right.  We come here after work, right before they close at 12:30, and the nuggets and fries are fresh out of the fryer.  Also one of the few Wendy's that has 3 frosty machines and I like vanilla.   Only bad thing is they need a new microphone.   Talk loud when you order or they can't hear you."

I\u2019d do it again.\n\nSo check em out if you\u2019re ever in the neighborhood and Holla at a Playa. \ud83d\udc4c\ud83c\udffe Came here for breakfast the other day. They took a very long time which was okay cuz I thought maybe they were waiting on potato wedges or fresh chicken but my food was cold. Also, I requested vanilla syrup in my coffee and there was no syrup and they only gave me a syrup packet for pancakes. Maybe not the best location to go for breakfast. If you're in a hurry or want fresh food and your order, correct. No buns, and the meat burnt as possible. This is just crazy to even process what dumbass would forget to put on buns on a SANDWICH and lets not forget the burnt meat, my dog didn't even want to eat it. You'd think it would be a good Wendys since it's a busy location, but it's not that great. Always long wait times and snippy drive thru people. I haven't had a specific bad issue with the food, but it doesn't seem up to par.\n\nIf you order a normal meal, they will probably get it right, probably. Cant make simple orders. 2 times I have tried to give this place a chance but nope the majority or the staff very rude. The first time I went all I asked for was a large cherry vanilla coke nothing ice. It was packed full of ice. To the brim the second time I asked for 2 spicy chicken sandwiches just onions. I received one with that and the other was just a normal everything on it spicy chicken."

    "reviews": "Today is Mother's day. The owner Dina helped me at the counter. She looked unhappy. As I asked if they have a lunch special, like they have during the week; the owner pointed straight up with her finger on both hands without a word. I say okay. Then I  order my usual 2 slices with pepperoni and a small drink. Dina looks at her husband chef and in her language says something I can not understand. After the rude interaction and embarrassed I got my drink. No lids but one that doesn't fit. Awesome service. I expected Dina to remember her current customers especially when she says, \"Thank you; it was nice seeing you again\" she seemed unhappy I came in and ordered from her biz and it showed.....\nMy husband gets a hello Ken but today I got an angry finger instead..... Amazing stuffed pizza!  Sausage is top quality!  Sauce is excellent too. Im so stuffed, so satisfied from 2 slices. You\u2019ve made a customer for life. Thanks for all Your Hard Work!  UPDATE: 2nd order just as delicious as the first!  3rd order was the NY pepperoni pizza. It\u2019s actually authentic NY pizza!!!  I\u2019m very impressed once again. Edit: just wanted to come back and say this food made us sick even tho we ate very little of it. DONT EAT HERE!!!!\n\nI just had my order delivered very fast, too fast. Fast delivery equals Old dry chicken took one bite spat it out instantly ( will not share that picture its gross) it's either overcooked or undercooked it has that nasty chicken flavor you can't get out of your mouth. Pizza looks delicious but its very very very untasteful, it has zero flavor I tried calling at 8:49 to let them know but phone just rang forever. We also ordered garlic bread no flavor the only thing that had flavor was the ranch and I doubt they make it themselves. It surprises me this place has good reviews I guess they just had a bad day maybe. Payed 70.15 for a bad experience not worth it. I order a calzone and I take two bites and I cracked my tooth on something as hard as a rock! I am so upset and disgusted Incredible service! The owner was very sweet and worked very hard to make sure we had delicious food in a timely manner. The pasta alfredo with chicken was some of the best of my life. A must visit in Westminster!"

    "reviews": "I really wanted to like this place. Super cute and loved the ambiance. The food was good and spicy.\n\nThe service was terrible! Took them over 15 minutes to tell us they didn't have the ginger beer for our cocktails. Ordered something else and it was terrible...pure lime juice. The bartender overall seemed uninterested and clearly longed to be somewhere else...Yawned a lot and messed on his phone (and then used unwashed hands to garnish). We won't be back. Great place from the decor to the service. I went on a halloween party and they had everything planned out. All of the staff was in costumes to encourage everyone to be ij a costume they where charging people without costumes which i think its not a bad idea. The waiters gave us very good service every time a bottle came to the table you get your little show off party. I would def coming to El Canton Cantina, yes mexican/latin style party but trust me thats where you want to be The Elote, chips, rice and beans are great; the Salsa, Asada and everything else weren't .  Their salsa was sweet, almost like it had a pickle relish backing kinda sweet.  The Asada was made from some kind of sub-par beef, it almost had the flavor of something from a Chinese place and it was stringy like someone was tenderizing a cheap cut improperly.\n\nThe service though, wow, I've never seen staff wired as backwards as they were.  I had to go and order a drink myself from the bar since our server was hopeless, I asked the bartender to have a beer sent to me and he just left it on the counter.  The metal piece that the Elote was hung from had visible debris on it like it had been sitting out somewhere unsanitary.  Really hoping we don't get sick from this one honestly       \ud83e\udd1e\ud83c\udffb not too confident in their operation.\n\nI'm pretty sure this is more for those who want dancing and a local night club, that being said I feel for the other reviewers on here that live in those apartments behind this place as they crank it so loud we couldn't have a conversation for dinner around 5PM and we're outside trying to escape it to begin with on the patio.  Only giving this 2 stars for the good Elote, get your act together! This place has no respect for anyone living around them. They blast music so loud it can be heard miles away at 1AM. The new menu is excellent, with an affordable price, great service,  lot of  parking, nice music, and friendly security."

    "reviews": "Great beer (we love finding Belgian beer spots!) Plus, you can\u2019t beat a brewery that allows dogs inside for those rainy or hot days. Great beer!!!!  The IPA was outstanding, as was the quad.    The Sour was very tarter but I would prefer a little more of the Blackberry fruit flavor.\n\nDog friendly and great service!   Can't wait to goback! I thought about being mad at this place, but fortunately, I\u2019m not allergic to beer\u2014and that\u2019s all they serve. They\u2019ve absolutely nailed their concept so I can confirm: it\u2019s fantastic. And you know what? I respect the hell out of the commitment. When I\u2019ve asked if they\u2019ll ever taint their pristine Belgian menu with wine or seltzer, I\u2019ve always gotten a confident, majestic no (3+ times!) Can you believe that? I\u2019m guessing they get asked that a lot and are tired of repeating themselves, but honestly, instead of caving to peer pressure, they listen to their patrons and double down on what they do best\u2014making beer lovers like me feel like I\u2019ve found my people. With their friendly staff and brilliant brews, there\u2019s never a dull option. (I recommend Blucifer!) I\u2019m always complimented on my impeccable beer choice!\n\nThese days, finding a brewery that hasn\u2019t sold its soul to hard seltzer is like spotting a unicorn in the wild. Even the smallest, most trend chasing breweries have cracked the mystical code of liquor licensing and thrown a pity seltzer or other watered down \u201cbeverages\u201d on the menu. But not Bruz! No, no, Bruz remains a shining beacon of beer purity, ensuring that anyone walking in expecting a White Claw is met with a polite but firm reality check!\n\nSo now, whenever my friends and I want to grab a drink, Bruz is always my first suggestion. When people ask me if they should try it, I tell them to stop wasting time and go immediately. I secretly hope it expands into an empire. I doubt it will, but one can dream! Also, they like dogs and let them inside! Who can be mad at that! Amazing, tasty, mellow, knowledgeable beer brewery! We were able to try dark logger, which tasted nice. We also had the brood root beer which was tasty and sweet. We came on a Friday night when we could\u2019ve gotten a cheaper flight of beers, but didn\u2019t need any extra alcohol for the ride home. We came to see a beautiful display of art here which is shown in my photos. I have also included the menu QR code so that you can check out their menu. We appreciated the multiple options for seating and the wide open spaces and also the knowledgeable bartenders. It was also nice to just walk up to the bar whenever you needed anything, and otherwise you weren\u2019t disturbed. I always have an incredible time as a regular here. I\u2019ve been in the neighborhood for over a year and have so many amazing things to say about all staff and the community of regulars there. i do want to give a particular shout-out to Brendon, who\u2019s new here and offered an exceptional service and environment and has been incredibly kind to my dog Bentley!"

    "reviews": "I was not expecting much from a hotel bar/restaurant. But the atmosphere, service and food were all excellent. Our meals were huge and really yummy. The place was pretty busy. Definitely recommend. I do NOT recommend this place if I could give zero stars I would. My family and I have been staying at the DoubleTree since Friday. For 2 nights in a row we\u2019ve been attempting to have Dinner here after recommended during our check-in. There are NO welcoming staff or attendants. There has always been a wait time that would keep getting extended, and none of the employees seem friendly or helpful about it.\nMy husband and I decided to show up at 10 PM for a drink and see how the bar service was.\nThere was another couple ahead of us waiting and staff just walking past, with very FEW patrons and costumers, many tables open.\nWe finally got seated at the bar and the lady who sat us down started to sweep around us which was annoying so I purposely dropped some crumbs before we left. We ordered the wings and there were freakin FEATHERS in our chicken. There is nothing \u201cbar and grill\u201d in this atmosphere, the only smile we got from the server was when we were leaving because they were closing. I feel bad for the elderly couple who stated he was hungry,  just came in on a flight delay, and all they told them \u201cour grill is closing in 5 minutes\u201d This is my second visit to Tower Tap & Grill during my business travels, and once again, it did not disappoint! The chicken tenders here are hands down some of the most delicious I\u2019ve ever had\u2014perfectly crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside. Great spot with a welcoming vibe, solid menu, and friendly service. Definitely a go-to for a satisfying meal when I\u2019m in town! Excellent food, drinks, and service. Couldn't ask for much more that's attached to a hotel. Close proximity to the airport and has a full bar and a full food menu that will appease anyone. My wife and I went here last night, and despite it being busy, we got great service. We got the tower dip, an experiment as it\u2019s not our usual type of appetizer. It was delicious. I got the shrimp scampi, and she got a burger and they were fantastic. She got the chocolate tort, and I went for the raspberry sorbet and it was the perfect end to our meals. We also had a few drinks, and they were great too."

    "reviews": "We arrived at our hotel quite late and walked across the road to this little Bistro in the Marriott Courtyard hotel. We were pleasantly surprised by the friendly chef Kerri and the attractive choices at reasonable prices. We chose the Grilled Cheese and Tomato Soup and found a comfortable corner to eat. Both were excellent and Kerri\u2019s friendly demeanour, especially after a long day, made it great. Limited menu. Overpriced food. Waited on my food in the lobby, no one called out a name or anything, so walked over and it was sitting on the counter (place your write-in order on paper, take to front desk who then walks it to the kitchen - weird rather than just ordering from the \"bar area\").\n\nI'd go elsewhere... I know it's an airport hotel, so overpriced and low-quality is to be expected, but still. I just felt so scammed, and I'm pretty sure I experienced this before but forgot and didn't write a review or anything... so this review more than anything is for my own memory. The attitude of the overworked individual who staffs the place also felt pretty deja vu and disappointing in contrast to the hotel check-in counter. I\u2019m surprised this place even has a 3.9 rating. It should be lower. Rude staff, way over priced, and food was not good. I had to paper order a burger with an arugula salad. What I received was a soy bean tiny patty with some pickles, a piece of lettuce, 3 pieces of arugula (so no salad?), cheap bread and a side of ketchup for $20. OMG.  This burger is smaller than a child's meal. 15 for a tiny shoe leather cooked to death sore excuse for food. Lady at register was Amazingly nice. not her fault."

I had the fajita steak tacos and they were out of this world. The layers of flavor in each bite were just unreal\u2014something you don\u2019t find in your average taco spot. If you\u2019re in Colorado, this place is a must. You won\u2019t regret it! It was good but not as good as the first time we visited but also this second time, it was so busy- so wondering if that made an impact on the quality of the tacos.  My black cod taco was easy to salty this time, and the grilled shrimp was not as good  but the fried shrimp taco was delicious.  It's expensive to.  But overall it's decent, everyone should try it at least once. Imagine Tex-Mex with a touch of authenticity and flair that makes you feel right at home. Whether it\u2019s date night, a corporate event, or a pregame spot, this place delivers incredible food at surprisingly affordable prices. The seasoning, flavors, heat, and diverse menu options\u2014along with top-quality drinks\u2014truly stand out. Be sure to ask for Ashley when you visit\u2014her service is fantastic! Stay awhile\u2014you\u2019ll love it! Very cool place to stop in for tacos and drinks.  They have a cute outdoor section with a fire pit.  The food was OK but the drinks were top notch. Shout out to Cisco he was our bartender and was so friendly.  Check it out if you're in town. Food tasted very good. The staff was on top of things. Only part I didn\u2019t like was how expensive it was for the tiniest portions. I spent nearly $30 for 3 tacos the size of my palm, a soda, and a little cup of rice and beans. Not worth it. And I\u2019m coming from DC area where everything is expensive. I get that it\u2019s locally made, but way too overpriced."

Huge screen showing customizable programming in customizable sized \u201cboxes\u201d so you can\u2019t miss any action from any sport. Bar and seating are has a good vive to it. The service was great! Friendly, attentive, and polite! The food was good. American Bar food with a \u201cmountain flare\u201d, I would call it! Nadja was incredible!! She not only provided a great service, but great conversation and entertainment. I would gladly come back again if this is the kind of service this establishment provides. The food was also incredible \ud83e\udd24. Wow, this place nearly gets a perfect five stars! However, the bar design definitely missed the mark by facing away from that stunning, high-end video wall! But let me tell you about the Brussels sprouts \u2013 they were hands down the best I\u2019ve ever tasted! I\u2019m rating them a solid 10 out of 10; you absolutely HAVE to try them! The pickled onion was the chef's kiss that took the dish to the next level, and that whipped feta cheese! What an incredible twist! Harrison was on point with the water refills!  His customer service was excellent! Mountain Pass Sports Bar \u2013 \u201cBig Screens, Big Salad\u2026 and Shredded Chicken Glory\u201d\nRating: \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606\u2606\n\nOkay friends, let\u2019s talk about Mountain Pass Sports Bar at the Gaylord Hotel near Denver \u2014 where the TVs are HUGE \ud83d\udcfa, the views are gorgeous \u26f0\ufe0f, and the salads come with a side of chaos \ud83e\udd57.\n\nWe showed up with a tiny crew of just 50+ people \ud83d\ude05 and even called ahead the day before like responsible grownups \u2705. But when we got there? Cue the confusion \ud83d\ude2c. No one knew we were coming. So we stood around awkwardly like a flash mob that forgot the dance moves \ud83d\udd7a\ud83e\udee3. Eventually, we got split into smaller tables like a restaurant version of musical chairs \ud83c\udfb6\ud83e\ude91 \u2014 not exactly the bonding experience we had in mind.\n\nNow onto the food\u2026\n\nI ordered the Chicken Caesar Salad \ud83d\udc14\ud83e\udd6c, and let me tell you \u2014 this thing was a unit. Absolutely HUGE. My photo of it looked so good I almost hired it as a food model \ud83d\udcf8.\n\nThe chicken was actually awesome \u2014 shredded and pulled into juicy little chunks like they knew what they were doing \ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udd25. Big props on that.\n\nBut here\u2019s where things got tricky: the lettuce was chopped so small, I couldn\u2019t stab a proper bite with my fork \u2014 it just slipped and slid like I was trying to catch a greased piglet \ud83d\udc16\ud83e\udd23. So I switched to scooping\u2026 but salad doesn\u2019t like to be scooped, y\u2019all. It was like a romaine rodeo every time I tried to get a bite in my mouth \ud83c\udf00\ud83e\udd44. I spent twice the time eating this salad than I normally would, all while fighting leafy rebellion.\n\nAnd while it looked well dressed (the salad, not me), I could\u2019ve used a little more dressing magic \ud83d\udca6\u2728. Needed just a touch more zing.\n\nThe vibe, though?\nOn point. Big ol\u2019 TVs everywhere \ud83d\udcfa\ud83d\udcfa\ud83d\udcfa, tons of space to spread out, and those Colorado mountain views were the real MVP \u26f0\ufe0f\ud83d\udcaf. Perfect for watching the game with a brew and a buddy (just maybe not a whole conference room full of people).\n\nBonus shoutout to our server, who was a total champ \ud83e\uddd1\u200d\ud83c\udf73\ud83d\udcaa. Super friendly, handled the chaos like a pro, and kept the good vibes flowing even when the logistics were a bit\u2026 crunchy. Servers like that deserve a raise and a Caesar crown \ud83d\udc51.\n\n\u2e3b\n\nFinal verdict:\n\u2705 Awesome chicken\n\u2705 Great server\n\u2705 Amazing ambiance\n\u274c Lettuce fight club\n\u274c Group seating mystery adventure\n\n3 out of 5 lettuce-launching forks\nWould I go back? Maybe\u2026 but I\u2019m bringing a spork and a seating chart next time.\n\n(Streaming soon on Salad Wars: Denver Drift \ud83e\udd57\ud83c\udfce\ufe0f) Nadja provided the best service. My party of 7 took her recommendations and loved them. The fried chicken sandwich and mountain nachos were great. Kids meals too. Thank you Nadja!"

The cottage pie was divine. Will definitely be back. This is such a fun place to eat! The atmosphere is cozy and warm which is nice. There were plenty of food and cocktail options to choose from!\n\nThe cottage pie is a MUST order! So is the Ruben! We wanted to try the fish and chips, but that would have been too much!\n\nThe French martini was nice and light!\n\nI ate there for breakfast the next morning as well! A slightly small menu I would say, but the food was good! I ordered the Prospectors Breakfast with scrambled eggs and sourdough toast and bacon for the meat. The bacon was cooked perfectly! The potatoes were well seasoned. Pretty cheap in my eyes too! Josh P was so friendly and fun. He made sure we had a wonderful lunch experience. The food was delicious. They did a great job accommodating allergies. If I could give the service 10 stars I absolutely would. Our recent visit here gave us the desire to come back again with the great food and impeccable service. Thank you again to our server Josh that made our visit so fun. My friend and I had an amazing time while Josh recommended from the menu. The food was delicious, but Josh made it special for us.  Looking forward to eating here again."

    "reviews": "Incredible food, impeccable service. Dena the dining room manager helped us celebrate our anniversary and she did an incredible job. Pastry chef Amanda made sure our dessert was a highlight (Dessert was my favorite part); but the drinks and entrees did not disappoint either. Will definitely be back. Can't wait to see what else they have to offer in during other seasons! Nice restaurant, but not a Michelin star restaurant which the price would suggest. I got a special 30 day aged steak and my wife got a fillet, both were great.  We also got the mashed potatoes and brussels sprouts, which were both better than expected. We shared $168 bottle of wine normally priced at 90, I don\u2019t think they have any wines by the glass. My issue isn\u2019t the total price, which was around 415+ tip. My issue is that it was about a $250 meal. If this is the best place you\u2019ve ever eaten at then you\u2019re gonna be wowed, however if you\u2019ve eaten true Michelin star incredible meals this is twice the price that it should be. Unfortunately, the way they separate the sides from the main course feels like a cash grab. Based on the value, I can\u2019t really recommend this place. However, if you have mad stacks of cash, get in there, blow it, relax and enjoy yourself! Excellent food, delightful service with very welcomed recommendations. Steak cooked perfectly, crab served split making it easy to enjoy. And great wine. But prices are very \u201cresort\u201d level and served a la cart, no sides or salads. Just your steak. Be ready to pay, but great food and service to enjoy. Stopped here while in town for a conference. I had the pear soup, kale salad and scallops. Hands down the scallops were phenomenal and I would come back for those alone. The he pear soup had great flavor, but a little sweet for my pallet. I also got the kale and apple salad, the flavors were nice, but I believe the kale was a little bit too bitter and overwhelmed the other ingredients subtle flavors We had an unforgettable experience from the very beginning, starting with the freshly baked bread and culminating in a nearly perfect Tomahawk steak. Our classy server, Chris, went above and beyond to make our anniversary dinner truly special, such a professional, who offered superb service."

    "reviews": "Good atmosphere clean good service. The pho broth was average. I did like that you could grab as much basal, lime, and bean sprout you wanted to put into your pho. You do get a good amount of meat in your pho. I also like the fact that you can add whatever meats you want in the pho. I would come back. Their spring rolls are good with a really good peanut sauce. The Vietnamese coffee was good but average. Really good flavor, large portions, good quality food. The spicy pho was too hot for me and a bit sweet, so not my thing. But everything else I\u2019ve enjoyed so much Get the spicy beef pho with oxtail! So delicious! Hands down the best Pho I\u2019ve had in CO. My only suggestion\u2026..PLEASE CLEAN THE BATHROOM AND TABLES. We came on a Sunday and several tables were not cleaned and the bathrooms were nasty :( Love the pho definitely one of the better places in town. I visit in order from this place frequently but my last to go order left me bummed. payed $6-7 extra for the beef rib which is totally fine when I eat at the restaurant. But getting this as a \"beef rib\" was really disappointing. all grissle and bone with very little meat. Yes, this is a counter service type of establishment. But contrary to some reviewers here, I actually liked that. One, because I can get as many bean sprouts, basil leaves, and jalapenos as my heart desires. And Two, tipping is really optional.\n\nThat aside, the food here actually blew my mind. I understand now why this place has a 4.6 rating after nearly 800 reviews. I loved the flavorful broth with long green onions, the fragrance of the herbs within, the fact that you can order bone marrow as an add on! They also have some more traditional dishes (besides pho) that brings Vietnam to your doorstep.\n\nTake it from someone who's Vietnamese, this place is the real deal if you're looking for no nonsense delicious Vietnamese food. I cannot wait to come back."

    "reviews": "My husband and I dined at this establishment today. Unfortunately, the service was not good ; we waited nine minutes before being acknowledged. Upon discovering a self-service kiosk, we placed our order. While our order did  arrive promptly, and the food was served hot, and the bathrooms were  clean, (wasn\u2019t given a code I was told to wait for the other customer to finished ) however the service was lacking.\nMy husband and I waited for 8 minutes for the bathroom code (for him)and we still didn\u2019t get the code . We left &  used a bathroom at a gas station while we were there. We seen two people walk out. \u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f AMAZING CUSTOMER SERVICE EXPERIENCE!\n\nToday, I had an unexpected experience at Wendy\u2019s, and I just have to share it. I placed an order online, and when I arrived to pick it up, I was told that someone else had mistakenly taken my order! \ud83d\ude31 It was a bit surprising, but I asked to speak with the manager, and WOW \u2014 what a fantastic response! The manager and her team went above and beyond, immediately preparing my order again with the kindest attitude and utmost professionalism. \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffd\ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffd\n\nI couldn\u2019t be more pleased with how they handled the situation. It\u2019s rare these days to find a place where the team genuinely cares about making sure every customer has a positive experience, and Wendy\u2019s definitely nailed it! \ud83d\ude0a This location in Westminster is always my go-to whenever I\u2019m in town, and after today, I have even more reason to keep coming back.\n\nThe food? Incredible as always! \ud83c\udf54\u2764\ufe0f Their burgers are deliciously juicy, the coffee \u2615\ufe0f is on point, and the menu has something for everyone. Wendy\u2019s is one of those places where you know the quality is always going to be top-notch.\n\nA big thank you to the manager and the entire staff for not only fixing the issue but also making me feel valued as a customer. \ud83d\ude4c\ud83c\udffd It was truly a five-star experience. And I\u2019ll make sure I\u2019m extra careful in the future to order on time \u23f1\ufe0f and be present so this doesn\u2019t happen again.\n\nThanks again to the amazing team here! You\u2019re the reason I\u2019ll be a Wendy\u2019s customer for a long time. \ud83e\udd47\ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffd Ordered a Dave's Double with just ketchup and mayo. Received a single patty cheeseburger. Would be great if the staff double checked things before putting them in bags. It's really an inconvenience to have to drive back to a location because no one could get the order correct. I shouldnt have to unwrap every item in my order before driving off to make sure its correct. Literally the worst service. It was simple request but the drive thru employees couldn\u2019t do it. I understand that everyone has a bad day but I literally was given my food and asked a question. Ignored. Then waited all three drive thru employees looked at me and then disappeared. Then I had to yell for someone to come to the window. To then be greeted like my a second class citizen. It felt a lot like discrimination. If I could give 0 stars I would.  Whether we order door dash or get drive through our order is never right.  When we take it back to them they make it seem like it's our fault they can't read or listen to what we order. Management is horrible and the kitchen staff don't know their head from their rear end.  Do not recommend we will io longer order from here"

    "reviews": "Very rude. Went there today for the first time as I\u2019m getting to know this neighborhood. The staff turned up loud music as I\u2019m speaking to a relative on the phone. Okay, it\u2019s understandable, but then as I\u2019m trying to continue speaking they turned it up even louder & I couldn\u2019t even enjoy my conversation. Left without finishing my drink due to the loud music. It felt like they didn\u2019t want to serve me or deal with me. It\u2019s a cute neighborhood bar but I wouldn\u2019t go back due to the lack of respect. I\u2019m a paying customer & great tipper. I deserve the same respect as everyone else. Unacceptable behavior in my opinion. Excellent service! Very friendly and helpful staff. Food is amazing. Loved the live music and location.  But I felt uncomfortable with the two security guards. The two guys in bulletproof vests acted like a fight or shooting was about to happen. ...our whole party(5 of us) left bc there is no reason for security like that in such a small bar. I'll not be returning unless they get normal guards. Called the restaurant to ask a simple question got hung up on four separate times. Staff is very rude and unprofessional at a job that is so simple. Wow a night to remember I got wasted Drinking beers with the beautiful Jessica and all the rest of the waitresses now I know where to spend my Friday\u2019s nights Those girls are wild they where all Over me Jessica your the best"

    "reviews": "This place was an absolute 10/10. My family came to Denver for a ski trip and stopped by here for breakfast. The food, the service(shoutout to Jackie for her excellent service!) and atmosphere were all an absolute 10/10. The food portion sizes are big and the price does not break the bank by a long shot! Definitely coming here again! I had the strawberry shortcake French toast with scrambled eggs! Cute place. Definitely came here for the breakfast. The food was served incredibly hot. And the pancakes were so delicious and fluffy that I really did not need to use syrup. The butter and cream that they slapped on there was just fine. A little flavor on the eggs and the omelette was delicious as well. The one thing that I was a little bit, disappointed about was the green beans. I did not know that the green beans were gonna be smothered in bacon and pork fat. It didn\u2019t say that they were going to be drenched in meat I thought I was just getting some green beans. But other than that overall beautiful and delicious location. Went to Great Scott's  on Saturday for the car show the food was amazing, music was good seen so many people there. My friends and I had such a good time.  I want to give a shout out to Great Scott's and the  staff for a amazing job and all the hard work they put into it.  Looking forward to the next one. Not coming back. I\u2019ve been here a few times for breakfast and dinner. Both most times the leftovers went to the dog because I couldn\u2019t eat them. One was a breakfast skillet, the potatoes and eggs were horrible,the other was salmon and green beans. The salmon didn\u2019t even taste like fish at all and the beans were clearly heated canned beans. Never again.\n\nServer was nice, love the decor. Modern take on an old fashioned diner. Huge booths easily accommodate 6 adults.\nEaten here twice, both times ordered the Loaded Jalapeno Bacon Burger, once with onion rings, once with fries.\n\nI like ALL the fixings with my burger and plenty of them. The basket included lots of lettuce, tomato, pickles, onion, and jalape\u00f1o! It was perfect. The jalape\u00f1o was wonderfully spicy, the bacon was an experience in itself \u2013 so flavorful. My only gripe was that the burger patty was slightly overcooked. The onion rings are great; fries are breaded, tasty. Food is fresh.\n\nThe $15 price is more than reasonable for a large delicious burger with a side.\n\nWaitress was fantastic, personable and attentive. She addressed some patrons by name. Definitely a welcoming restaurant."

    "reviews": "Sp here's the thing about the Ugly Dog, it's a super legit dive/sports bar. The service is always great. We had Diedra, and she was awesome as usual. But all the servers are on point. Drinks are cold, plentiful, and almost always well-made. My wife is a Cosmo snob and likes her Cosmos made a very specific way\nThey nail it every time. We've been too high-end bars all the way down to the rinkiest of dives, but the Ugly Dog always gets it right.\n\nWith just a ton of TVs on the wall, you're bound to find the game you're looking for. Is not, just ask the manager, server, bartender, or any of the staff. They will figure it out.\n\nAnd last, but certainly not least, their chow. Last night I went for the Philly Cheesesteak. Amazing. I mean don't get me wrong, this isn't the Capital Grille. But quite frankly, I wouldn't order a cheesesteak from CG, I wouldn't trust them to get it right. The Ugly Dog gets it right\ud83d\udcaa\ud83c\udffc. My wife and my homeboy, Julian, both went with the wings. And both SWEAR that these are the best wings in town. And both are legitimate wing snobs. I would trust them. Julian, who first turned me on to the Ugly Dog years ago, likes his wings hot. Like melt your face off hot. The Dog will oblige that request. A lot of places can't pull that off. The Dog can.\n\nGive this place a run through, you probably won't regret it and it might just become your place. Whether it's for a drink, a cold one, bar food or dinner, a football/basketball/hockey game,  or even a game of pool (yes the have multiple pool tables), this is the place. \u270a\ud83c\udffc Ugly Dog is a great spot if you're looking for an inexpensive, dog-friendly restaurant/bar. We brought our pups here when we came for dinner. There's a lot of food options for a great value. I ordered the \"Dirty Bird\" which came with 8oz of chicken (smothered in cheese and sauce) with rice and beans for just $12. They have daily specials, including $2 tacos on Taco Tuesdays. We also appreciated that they have a menu option for the doggos, a small bowl with meat and egg, which they scarfed down happily. Our server was very nice and brought the dogs some bowls for water.\n\nWe sat on the patio, which was a spacious open area under a tent. The inside of the bar was very lively with karaoke, but the patio was more quiet and relaxed, which was nice. One downside however is the patio area looks over the highway, so it's not the most scenic view. That said, it's a minor gripe considering how affordable the menu is. Did not order food, but the menu looks great both for appetizers and meal fare.\nThe service was excellent, the atmosphere is good-- IF you can tolerate the crazy mex gang-appeal music on the juke box. If not, use your juke box app  ( this place uses Touch Tunes) and play something that appeals more to the non-mex and non gang bangers of this community.\nThe staff here is terrific and prices are reasonable.\nThere was security at the door the evening (Wednesday) I visited. Bartenders are very sneaky ( Lucy) they will over charge or lie about what you have been charged for throughout your transactions! Also don't return with your change they feel entitled to their tip after you've payed for what you've ordered! I suggest always paying with card to keep record of what you've payed for! Chris(Topher) is one of the kindest and hard working bartenders I\u2019ve ever met. He has the best energy and took care of our larger group while maintaining the actual bar.\nIf you want to go to a place where everyone is welcome and has great food and drinks go to Ugly Dog! Monday night burger special is an awesome deal and the Mules were perfect.\nThe WWE and UFC paraphernalia ads to the atmosphere and there are so many TVs to choose from that you\u2019re guaranteed to be able to watch whatever sport/show you\u2019re looking for. They also have pool tables and a patio!\nThanks for a great night for us to remember!"

    "reviews": "As a UK person on my US fish n chip journey I can definitely recommend it here! The batter is crispy, well seasoned and cooked well, fish was slightly overcooked but very nice nonetheless. Chips were nicely cooked, the only thing to note was there is not many chips so would recommend getting an extra portion. Very nice malt vinegar, not watered down like some places. To make it perfect it would have been nice to eat the fish as a whole fillet instead of strips, where it cooks more evenly, but this is being pedantic and it's not going to put me off coming again. Oh and a nice surprise there were fish bits in the bottom of the box! Never had that here! Best fish n chips in Colorado so far! Also tried to ask for a Yorkshire discount as that was where I was born, but unfortunately it was a no \ud83e\udd23 Food is ok, I don't get what the fuzz is about to be honest. And it's VERY PRICEY not worth it for the lack of flavor. Flavor is non existent, all I could taste was the grease, fish and chips lacked basic salt and pepper any other seasoning/ any spice.\nTartar sauce... it was basically just mayo :/\n\nIf you are into deep fry by all means this is your place. Area is kinda sketchy but I didn't mind that since good food is often found in weird places.\n\nCustomer service 10/10 When I ordered a double fish, as a full dinner plus fried mushrooms, and a side of coleslaw I thought I was going to have some leftovers. The coleslaw was at best a quarter cup for about three dollars, which given the style of the place was a bit much. But the fish was cooked pretty well, they did skimp on the chips by filling the bottom of the basket with a handful of fried batter crumbs. Clam chowder best I\u2019ve had in Denver. Very basic interior pleasant counter personnel. Let's start with the food. The fish is big. 2 pieces was enough. The fries are also decent, I ordered the coleslaw and wasn't disappointed. We also ordered an order of the clams, and they are just strips and not the bellies. For the price it would have been nice, however the clams were not dried out so that is a plus. The dining area is simple and wasn't busy when we went at 11:30. Overall a bit pricey for the food but bad. Would eat here again if I was in the area, but wouldn't go out of my way."

    "reviews": "Hands down my new favorite steak place. The steaks were tender, well seasoned, and reasonably priced. The atmosphere is down to earth and what you\u2019d want for a chill date night.\n\nAlly was our bartender and is incredibly welcoming and was a delight to joke with. The service is fast and friendly from all their staff.\n\nWe had a wonderful time and will be coming back very soon. I quite enjoyed dining here yesterday for brunch! The Surf and Turf... Wow. So delicious. The steak had a nice crispy and seasoned crust. I asked for grilled onions and mushrooms to top it off! Absolutely loved the shrimp and veggies. It had butter and rally good seasonings in it. The steaks are really good and the service! Rachel was a great server who made sure our table was well taken care of; especially being new customers to this place. I'll definitely be coming back. With the history, the place is outdated. But don't let that stop you from going in... the food and service was great! It was my first time trying cowboy butter and I was impressed with the quality of meat. It was tender and juicy. We also got the weeknight special which was the jalepeno and crab crust steak. That was incredible! You can definitely tell it was actual Crab meat and not the imitation kind. They have a very menu, including Mexican dishes, some seafood, and of course steaks, which is why we went. The decor is rustic and eclectic .  The friendly staff willingly engages with you making for a fun experience. Every dish we had was well prepared \u2013 delicious. We had the filet mignon and large porterhouse; both were seasoned and cooked to ourexact liking. Both the mac & cheese and saut\u00e9ed vegetables were a pleasant surprise and would definitely order them again .  Given the price and quality of the food,  it was an outstanding value.  Next time we\u2019ll try to save room for dessert. Very, very good food. My brother, my dad, and I decided to come here as we were visiting Denver for the day. I'm glad we did! My brother and I had the Porter House (24 ounce bone in) with the Garganzola Crust. First time ever trying it, and it was worth it! The Chile and the Green Chili Mac and Cheese had a bite to it, but it was very tasty, and the Mac and Cheese was creamy and cheesy. Our waitress, Araceli, did a good job, and she is the first one who's had confidence in the taste of the steak. Never had someone told me that A1 sauce wasn't needed with their steak! \ud83d\ude02 But im glad I ate it without it because it definitely does not need A1 sauce. Ended with a strawberry cheesecake and Grandma's Cobbler. It's worth the price of $40 and an additional $2 for the crust. I'd definitely come back again!"

    "reviews": "We enjoyed a neighborhood walk for lunch today, and we're very pleased with the crispy fried edges on the burger patties, delicious!  Eric is a fantastic waiter, and we try to get him each time we go.  Big screen from every seat.  Kolch beer is the deal.  Thank you! Our experience at this Tuesday was utterly disappointing. Despite not being as crowded as other locations, we received terrible service. Our server brought us water but took an exorbitant 20 minutes to bring a beer. Throughout our entire visit, he completely neglected to check in on us. To make matters worse, he made a mistake with our order, and when we informed the manager, he became visibly upset. Our waiter kept ignoring us, so I had to resort to asking the waiter at the bar to get a refill of water for my son. This was the worst service I have ever experienced with my family. My husband and I waited 15 to 20 minutes before being seated after we were told 5 to 10 minutes. There were multiple tables open not being used.  They got us seated then another 5 to 10 minutes to get our drink and food order. My husband's food came out cold. The bottom bun to my burger was hard. It was disgusting food . Won't be coming back to this Buffalo Wild Wings. They either need a whole new kitchen staff or a whole new staff period. On 9/4/24, I requested the ranch flavored wings. As many of you might know this flavor is not on their menu. Nonetheless, this institution was willing to accommodate this auspicious request. Truly this alone makes this Buffalo Wild Wings worthy of praise.\n\nParker, our main server, has always been a fantastic server for our group. I feel blessed to have such a consistently remarkable server.\n\nWhenever I come to this Buffalo Wild wings, I feel at peace and a part of the family. My most recent outing has only enlarged this feeling of welcoming.\n\nI will continue to attend this fine establishment every Wednesday. Whether rain, snow, or hail, I will make the trek out to this Buffalo Wild Wings to experience the true community this eatery has to offer. Our waitress was a hero! They were clearly understaffed, and they got one of our orders wrong. However, My salad was delicious. One of our dishes, the chipotle bbq, came with a powdered dry dressing. We were expecting a dip. Our waitress fixed that right away. Our margaritas were small and light, but we had a great conversation. All things considered I can only take one star because the good was really good."

    "reviews": "Super wonderful. Great, friendly, smart, caring staff. Had lunch inside and employee (tall guy) checked on how I was doing? What? This is incredible. The woman taking my order was excellent, friendly, sweet, and accurate with my order. You all are 5 star, all the way with my experience. Thank you for making my visit, wonderful. I went to this location last night and was seriously appalled by the service I received. My husband and I both recently had surgery and decided on eating out for dinner. I thought Chik Fil A would be a good option as I\u2019ve never received bad service but it\u2019s the first time I went by myself. I don\u2019t know if it was my race or what (she was very polite to the Caucasian gentleman in front of me) but the young lady, Katie, at the window was just plain rude the entire time. For the life of me I could not figure out why. Then to top it off they gave me cold waffle fries, and my milkshakes were only halfway filled with a tiny bit of whipped cream. It was so weird. & really rubbed me the wrong way. I went home after paying $30 for two sandwiches with half our drinks and cold food. I will absolutely never go back. I\u2019ll be reaching out to corporate as this is 2025 and I found her behavior towards me, a paying customer, unacceptable. One of the top chick fil a locations!\n\nSimply put, this installment never fails me. Orders are right. The staff is attentive but not as pushy as other locations. The lines aren\u2019t usually too bad. And the food is done quickly. Simply the best fast food place in town. The customer service is second to none. Everyone is always so polite and helpful.\n\nMy only criticism is sometimes in the later hours the fries can be a little dry, but aside from that everything else is perfect. If you're looking for a quick and convenient dining experience, this restaurant is a great choice! The chicken sandwiches are delicious, and they offer a good variety of healthy and vegetarian options. The atmosphere is casual and comfortable, with accessible amenities like restrooms and free Wi-Fi. Free parking and options like delivery, takeout, or dining in make it even more convenient. Highly recommend!"

    "reviews": "How was every single ingredient bad? UNDERCOOKED chicken. Guacamole that tastes only like salt. Rice and beans that taste only like salt. Old queso. Undercooked fajitas veggies that were overly soggy. It was $12.\n\nDo better. I\u2019ll be lucky if I don\u2019t get sick from the few bites I took of this \u201cfood\u201d. Came in while they were closing and in the middle of cleaning. Got some of the best service at any qdoba I\u2019ve ever had. Vinnie and the rest of the staff here are super hero\u2019s and deserve a raise! Went in to get a burrito this morning around 9:20a. While I was paying, she left the burrito by the credit card machine, without putting it in a paper bag. The burrito wasn't totally covered, and just left it on the counter like that? Or do I need to ask for a bag? I ordered my food online expecting it to be ready when I got there since it is a fifteen minute drive. I showed up, they didn't even start my order. The girls making the food were putzing around and filling up the guac and other food. They got my order name, started the order, and promptly stopped anytime new customers showed up. Eight orders went by me... Another twenty minutes later they finished. They didn't even give me the shredded cheese on my nachos.\n\nI will never order online again because it asked me to tip, which I did. Failure.\n\nBooooooo!!!!!! Ate here several times while I was in town and it was always a good experience. Food was generally warm and fresh-tasting, and I feel like I got my money's worth every time. There's a nice selection of ingredients and add-ons to experiment with until you find your favorite, so it shouldn't get boring.\n\nHas a well-maintained lobby and countertop. Floor and tables were consistently clean, and while there aren't a lot of tables there is some outdoor seating for those inclined.\n\nStaff was friendly and accommodating. I often stayed late and never felt like I was being pushed out. Can't comment on what they're like in a crunch since I always came well after the dinner rush, but I generally went from counter to table and eating within 2 minutes."

    "reviews": "what a great local sports bar. Thank you Dennis , Cat , and Melissa for the  exceptional service. Really good food especially the burgers, reuben sandwich and smiked wings plus bottomless fries and some great drink specials. Had a wonderful evening with our kiddos at Bout Time.  They were super busy and only had 1 employee who worked the floor and bar. Although, he was the only person, he did his absolute best to accomodate every person in there with a smile and friendly. Wish I would have caught his name to Thank him again. The food was just as delicious as before. I would have given a 5 on food but my chips were very burnt. I tried to eat them and couldn't. Our server brought me another batch. Would definitely go back again!\nVery KID friendly.\nOur family will be back soon. Chicken Caesar salad was not very good, especially for $14.95, I do not recommend it at all. I ended up picking out the tiny bits of chicken and the croutons and leaving most of the rest. Definitely needs more/bigger pieces of chicken, more croutons, shaved Parmesan, and a better Caesar dressing. Also not sure why a Caesar salad had chopped up bits of tomato throughout too.\n\nService was great (Melissa), drink was good and she was very accommodating.\n\nVery loud though. Host was reading off trivia questions, with loud music on and TVs. We couldn\u2019t hear the people at our own table and there were less than 20-30 people in the entire place. Turn off or turn down one of the competing sounds when doing trivia at least. I had a great experience at Bout Time Sports Bar! The food was absolutely fantastic\u2014we tried the burgers and the kabob sampler, and both were delicious. It's American cuisine, but with a unique twist that really sets it apart. The quality is far above your typical bar food, making it well worth the price.\n\nThe atmosphere is cozy with plenty of TVs for watching sports, which makes it perfect for game day. Despite its smaller size, it feels lively and welcoming.\n\nOur waitress was wonderful\u2014super friendly, attentive, and gave us great recommendations from the menu. It\u2019s clear the staff here goes above and beyond to make you feel taken care of.\n\nWhile I don\u2019t drink anymore, I noticed they have some awesome drink specials that others seemed to enjoy. Overall, I had such a positive experience here and will definitely be coming back! Melissa, is the best host and gives the best service that I have ever had in any bar or restaurant i have ever been to! She truly cares about her customers being 100% happy every time they walk out the door! If I could give Melissa 500 stars on this rating, I would! David Aldridge"

I truly hope the owner of this place sees how amazingly he handles his job, even during busy hours, and gives him the recognition he deserves. Thank you for kind service! Waited in the drive through for 12 mins waiting for one of the more simple orders of the day. Food was cold and I was upset. The location had no one waiting at the time and I was the first one in the line. Very disappointed due to the fact a single deluxe burger is now over $5. Prices are through the roof and as someone from Wisconsin, the quality just isn't the same from my home state.\n\nEdit: 4/25/25. New photo added about Icecream Have never been here before & it was my first time trying this place out! Amazing friendly service, spacious + cozy atmosphere. Has a lot of fried variety o options. Love the cheese curds + onion rings. My son loved the fries so\u2026. It is a 5 star for us because of the friendly service, tasty food & cozy clean vibe. The burger & other choices look exactly like the menu! So right on!\n\nDo not throw away your sandwich bags you can redeem a free ice cream cone. Midnight Toffee is my favorite flavor of the day!  It was delicious and well mixed with dark chocolate custard, chocolate chunks, and heath bar.  Can\u2019t wait to go back next month! I don\u2019t know who\u2019s working the drive thru, but their enthusiasm is off the charts. It honestly made my day and moved me to make this five star review. Jolly experience! His name was Chad and he made my late evening."

Delicious Korean barbecue with all of the sides and fix-ins. You can even cook at your own table. Lunch specials. Take out. I love the bi Bim Bob I was used to Seoul Korean BBQ as my go to restaurant. But it was recently closed permanently. So I decided to try this place instead. Was sat quickly, explained the menu, and the all you can eat MEATS came rolling in shortly after. I was used to paying $43 per person at Seoul, but that same option here is $38, so that was awesome! Top quality flavor of marinated meats, delicious sides, highly recommend! Will be back often \ud83d\udc4c Best Korean BBQ in Colorado.  Great service. Great food. Lots to choose from but the BBQ is your best option. The staff is great. If you have never been they will explain the process. Great place to go for a date or meet friends. Highly recommend. Our group of 5 arrived during CU\u2019s busy graduation weekend and our servers handled our entire dining experience with such profound knowledge, professionalism, positivity, responsiveness, and consideration. Tara was the epitome of superior customer service throughout the evening and our entire family marveled at her boundless energy and dedication. From ensuring our water glasses were always filled to efficiently taking our additional orders, the wait staff demonstrated astounding synchronicity, dexterity and enthusiasm while serving absolutely delicious food. Our family has enjoyed stellar Korean cuisine in Asia, California & NJ throughout our lives so we were blown away by the quality of the service and food that made for a most memorable dining experience. Our family can\u2019t wait to return to dine again. Thank you!"

So I think this place has a lot of potential the owners are very warm and inviting the Thai food is amazing!!! It's not a dive and it's not completely a grill I wish I had some money to put into this place and and contribute to the owners this place could be very top-notch and amazing place like I said I love their food very authentic very delicious Mucho Rico!!! And every time I've been in I have always met really good people this is like not like some of the bars that I've been to people behave themselves here that's the way it should be have a good time talk to your neighbors get some good food go home and be happy. Found this bar and grill along Washington Street on a Saturday and decided to stop in. It sits on a bit of a hill so one can get a view of downtown Denver. The food is typical fare for a bar and grill - burgers, wings, and deep fried items like cheese sticks and onion rings. The chicken wings are different; they're cooked but not crispy or juicy on the inside, and they come naked with sides of sauce (i.e., not tossed in the sauce). Prices are reasonable and service is friendly. A good-sized parking lot and patio seats if the weather is nice outside. Best Thai food in Thornton, yes I said Thai food. Don't be misled by the classic charm and history of this place. The new owners are authentic Thai chefs, but they kept the classic charm of the bar.\n\nHave you drink and eat some 5 star food why dont you?\n\nWe had the drunken noodles and Thai fried rice. Both were amazing. I love going here for the food! The Thai food is delicious and I can't wait to try more of the menu. The fried rice is amazing and the dumplings are so good I always order extra. Wish I got a picture but I was too hungry. The fried mushrooms are also really good."

    "reviews": "Pay attention to the reviews. The majority is not wrong. I can't comment about the food, I received the wrong order, and when I went in, I was greeted by some obviously frustrated employees and was asked to leave. I normally try to find something positive about a location. This one may be that you can get fuel outside or stop next door and the convenience store. I am a little shocked this location has not received more attention from corporate, the all mighty dollar rules all. I hope your experience is better than mine was. I can\u2019t complain about the food, I work over at DIA and until now the employees have at least been friendly. I hope it\u2019s a new worker that hasn\u2019t been trained that I was helped by, very rude and didn\u2019t even let me finish ordering before I was interrupted, and cut off from ordering, thank you Wendy\u2019s for my last meal at this location! It would have been great to keep this open for me as a food spot but I am no longer interested I travel through Dia just about every week and every now and then I stopped here to get lunch or dinner. They are always consistently very slow to take your order. Tonight when I went through the drive-thru I waited for 5 minutes without a single person asking me what I wanted to order. I can see three people in the restaurant two of which looked out at the drive-thru and nobody even acknowledged I was there. This will be the last time that I visit this establishment. Once is unfortunate, twice is bad luck, three times, that's an insult. They have cut their service short early with me in line at their drive through the last three times I tried to order. This last time they told me it would be back in 20 minutes, so I waited, then they said it would be an hour, after they close. Turning me away is one thing but this was downright disrespectful. Unless this is your absolutely only option, it's best not to eat here. If you are looking for a subpar mediocre service that is run by absolutely incompetent high schoolers then this is your favorite place! Sat in the Drive-Thru with no acknowledgment for 4 to 5 minutes, then when I started to order the service attendant was very rude in telling me that certain items were not available with no apology. Then, no speed of service when reaching the window either. High schoolers just chit-chatting about random non-work related matters. Didn't receive a thank you or any invite to return again."

His smile and his wonderful customer service gave me the strength to go on. I love old Chicago. I have been coming here for years.

I will definitely be back here again \ud83d\udcaf\ud83d\udc4c\ud83c\udffe Staff are friendly and there are occasional fun events (trivia, bingo, etc).  Beer tour club is fun if you're into beer.  Food is fine but the portions-to-price ratio and quality seem off.  I got an entree chop salad and very little of it was \"chopped\" and it was more like a side salad. Excellent!  Great place, lots of seating and a bar area with many many beers on tap.  Watch your favorite game on the big screens  located throughout.  Ordered the Veggie 7 thin crust pizza.  It was delicious!  Loaded with 7 different veggies.  The small is just right for one person.  Service was great!  There was one guy, Bryan, who as running to take care of everyone. He was great!  They have other stuff on the menu including burgers, wings, salads and much more.  The food passing me by looked really good.  I\u2019d definitely go back to Old Chicago again."

The tortillas were fresh, there was a decent amount of cheese, and the white chicken breast pieces were moist and delicious. The steak quality was just okay. I did order \"special\" burritos and only got what looks like the basics. I won't be leaving such a good tip next time I\u2019ve been eating at this restaurant for nearly 50 years, and it\u2019s still hands-down one of my favorite places. The smothered Mexican hamburger with chicharrones is unbeatable \u2014 loaded with flavor, perfectly seasoned, and always hits the spot. The green chile is legit, and the chicharrones add that perfect crunch and richness. The staff is like family, and the vibe never changes \u2014 just good people and even better food. Places like this are rare. If you know, you know. I ordered over $40 in food and was eating with family and they not only lost my receipt but when I asked where my order was they said, \"we haven't called it out yet\" and when I asked why 5 other orders had been called they finally found out why! While waiting for my food the cook came to the counter that has had people putting their washed hands on it and didn't change gloves when she went back to make more food. I didn't feel that telling me the printer didn't print \"only my ticket\" was a good enough apology. Especially since the other people I was with had to watch me eat cause they got their food long before the mistake was discovered. I came all the way from Texas to eat my double Mexican hamburger \u2764\ufe0f, please bring a Chubbys to Eagle Pass Texas, I beg you. Love you all at Chubbys."

The taste was bland lack luster burger kings Tate much better Hand down the best vanilla sprinkle doughnut I have ever had the pleasure of enjoying!!! It was so good I tried to exchange the chocolate frosting doughnut I ordered with it. Unfortunately because it crossed the counter they could not take it back(understandable), but the manager gave me another vanilla on the house. To be totally honest I was a little disappointed with the coffee though. I remember it being stronger. Maybe it is just because just like the rest of America I've been desensitized and regular just ain't quite enough(thanks Stoks!(you guys really help putting the 'kick' back into my morning wakeup)) Lots of homeless in the area and sitting outside but they just want the thrown out donuts I believe ... And the app doesn't let you scan in receipts of your to use your REWARDS or in my case, your phone dies! So that's a bummer but otherwise delicious and friendly staff! (The Vanilla Moolatte is to die for!! Similar to Starbucks Vanilla Bean but I think it may be better even!!)\ud83d\ude2c\ud83e\udd14 This place is consistent in their quality of food everytime I have gone here its always good! There was a mix-up with my order and they were so kind about the whole thing!! They didn't make us feel badly at all about calling them and asking for them to fix it !!\nStore is very clean and very fast service ..\nHighly recommend going here of you want quality great customer service and are in a hurry !! Try the crossiant sandwiches and the toasted white chocolate mocha !! Worst food and costumer service. I went through the drive through on march 7, 2025 at 8:25 am\nAsk for a meal with coffee and hash browns. First of all hash browns were saggy and nasty. When I ask for a refund a coworker name DEREK came to me and ask for my card screaming at me !! He grabbed my receipt and ripped it!! Manager showed up after saying she\u2019ll will take care of him.\nI\u2019ll will follow up with corporate to see if they did something. This is unacceptable!!!"

    "reviews": "Just drove 10 minutes in a blizzard for lunch at 1pm and location is closed with a sign on the door \"sorry closed early today\"! Absolutely unacceptable and ridiculous! Close the stupid location permanently like every other Quiznos! Quiznos has been the worst run food corporation in history for the past 20+ years! Buncha losers! Had the large traditional. Tasted odd half way through and stopped eating it immediately.  Hoping not to get sick now. Food is great because this Quiznos rules. The staff is always ready to go and are really quick on making your sandwich(s). Never had an issue. This is one of the best sandwich experiences I have ever had at a sandwich food restaurant which led me to being full as ever. Thanks for the awesome experiences! My daughter and I drove over 20 minutes to get to a Quiznos because there's not very many open with a baby in the car and laundry waiting be transferred at the laundromat and you guys closed your doors early when the sign on the internet says you're open maybe you guys should post it on the Internet or leave your doors open for people's convenience The past three times I tried going here it was closed in the middle of the day. The last time I tried, there was a sign on the door that said they would be closed from 130-330. I sat in front of it until almost 4PM, when I decided to leave. Not worth the trip, you should definitely try somewhere else."

    "reviews": "Very unique and cute place. The attention to the interior detail really enhances the atmosphere. Cocktails are creative names but not the highest quality of craftsmanship. Food portions are great but your typical pub style food. The gaming tables are really what set this place apart I am a bit torn on this review. The food, drinks and vibe of this place is all great, however, your service will definitely depend on who is serving you.\nFrom my experience, I have had a tan skinned fellow, and a white skinned guy be my server. Tan skinned fellow is amazing, no complaints, he's awesome we always order extra, the Druidcraft and Elemental druid craft, alongside the mac and cheese, and Someone stole your sweetroll, all of these items highly recommend very good.\n\nNow for the bad. I have had the white guy be the bartender for me a few times, and both times he over charged me for things. First time I had him, I got a rootbeer, and one refill. He said there was a refill charge, which I was okay with because the menu says 1 dollar refills on it. So no worries, I go about and end the night later. Only after I realized instead of charging me for a 1 dollar refill, he charged me a full 4 dollars. 8 dollars, for 2 cans worth of soda if that. I chocked it up to maybe he being new and was an honest mistake.\nI go again, and me and my buddies were excited, we were planning on getting all our favorites, but I started the night off with a soda, not a rootbeer. They are 4 dollars with 3 free refills, before each refill is 1 dollar. Well, he charged me for my first refill. I didn't pay attention, but my buddies did, when he charged them for refills of theirs. They said it says 3 free refills and he drops it. We go up and tell him I shouldn't be charged a refill yet, and he made some excuse for me, and didn't drop the fee. Well even if only a dollar, I don't appreciate being screwed over it. Paired with his slow service, over 20 minutes just to get a pepsi, it basically ruined the excitement we had, and instead of the mac and cheese, someone stole your sweet roll, and the elemental druidcrafts we were looking forward to. We left and just got wendy's.\n\nWhile I definitely like the place, and I want to support it for the most part. I think if the bartender is trying to screw us over, I am just going to go elsewhere, and would advise everyone to keep track of your tab, to not get charged wrongly for your items. I've been to Thane's Table a couple times now and it's always a blast. The staff is awesome, the drinks are awesome (especially the Butterbeer), the food is awesome (especially the brisket mac n' cheese), what's not to love? The restaurants itself has so many fun decorations and lots of games to play if you need. Can't wait to try out the D&D rooms soon! Why did I not know about this place sooner! Cool freakin place! If you're a geek of any kind you should stop in. I had 2 drinks, Mana and Butter Beer, and soup in a bread bowl and it was all amazing. This was our first time at Thane's and it was an awesome experience! The employees had a great knowledge about their games and were willing to help find new games that you've never played. Drinks and food were fantastic that absolutely matched their names. We'll definitely be coming back here to spend several more hours on games!"

    "reviews": "I\u2019ve been coming here for years and love this place. Great happy hour and friendly staff.  The burgers are also great. There is plenty of room for me to bring both of my young kids too. As a LEO this restaurant is also a proud supporter of police and was one of the few businesses that still supported police when the state went crazy in 2020. I would highly recommend this restaurant if you are looking for decent food and friendly atmosphere. It\u2019s a little bit more harder to get in and out or parking due to the apartment complexes that they put in however, the building itself is plenty large. The service was great it was clean. The roast beef and the chicken sandwiches were fabulous. The funnel fries were over cooked and it should\u2019ve had powdered sugar on it Instead she says it had sugar and cinnamon however, I did not see nor taste sugar and cinnamon and they definitely were a little bit over cooked. Other than that everything else was great, the service was great and she was very friendly and knowledgeable. With the new apartments built around the place, it is definitely playing hide-n-seek for any hungry souls looking for a burger.\n\nThe place definitely has a more classic bar & grill vibe, sports and all. Not to mention this place is pretty damn huge, so there is plenty of seating here.\n\nThe food has a classic burger joint food, so obviously you gotta try a burger. That burger was pretty good and worth justifying trying to find this place at least once. Gave food a three since I did not have any.  Service was great, we had a large group and the staff was very attentive.  Atmosphere was different.  Felt like a big box with TVs and a bar.  Very plain inside.  Beer selection was limited in my opinion. This is a great place to visit. Stopped in for a bite and drink on Saturday afternoon. Place was packed. Food was hot and beer was cold. Des (Dez?), our bartender, was absolutely amazing. Very attentive and answered any questions we had. Loved the memorabilia on the walls.  Great Vibe."

    "reviews": "Dang.  We don\u2019t spend $$$ on wings often, they rack up quick.  But when the Bills are playing a big game we don\u2019t care! We need wings!  But super sad today.  These might be the tiniest wings ever.  $50 for 20 wings, mostly flats and seriously so tiny.  Did we get the end of the batch?  I\u2019ll be ordering from Old Chicago or Wings n things next time. This place serves some excellent wings! They have several several to choose from. I had the garlic and Thai chili. We got the #2 combo with waffle fries (that were amazing as well!) Their wings seem to average around $1ish a wing where most places are at $2 a wing and you only get half the quantity. Definitely worth the trip if you are around the Westminster area. This place is amazing! Wings are awesome! Perfectly cooked & sauced just right. I got the straight fries and have to say they are PERFECT! I usually don\u2019t eat all the fries - but these were so good I ate every last bite!\n\nService was excellent. Friendly, too.\n\nHighly recommend if you\u2019re a wing lover! I have been going to CD wings for a little while now and they have the best wings I have ever had. It\u2019s also one of the cleanest restaurants I have been to. Recently I had a problem with my order and management was very understanding and helped me out a lot. I love their team and their food! Highly recommend!! This is a once a week visit for our family. Best wings in town no contest. Sauces are all made in house and are so flavorful. Hoping they open one out in Brighton someday!\n\nPro tip: Ask for extra crispy wings swimming. Thank me later."

It was so good I went back again the same week, and have been back once every few weeks since.\n\nI really like the kick of the spacebird burrito, and the chips and queso. I like them so much that it has become my go to order almost every time. Don't sleep on the churro chips either!\n\nSee you soon Renegade Burrito. It\u2019s delicious. I\u2019ve eaten here dozens of times and I\u2019ve never had anything I didn\u2019t like. This place is unique and way different than Chipotle or Qdoba in a good way. Check it out! I have been a few times now, have tried their burritos for breakfast and lunch, and the more I come back, the better it gets! Great place! Decent flavor with the food. It\u2019s cheap and at a good price so come here if you want a decent tasting burrito for good prices. Not the best burrito, that\u2019s for sure, but a good quick spot. Decided to try this place after we found an ad/coupon in the mail. We are on the hunt for the best breakfast burrito. Overall pretty good! Nice flavor! Get the Strawberry Watermelon Tea if you go it\u2019s quite refreshing!  The restaurant was very clean. A few things would make it better. 1. If the food was hotter(temp) we ate it right away so this wasn\u2019t a we drove 15 minutes home and it was only warm. 2. More meat. You only get two small scoops. 3. Would love if the potatoes were crispy.\nOverall, a contender for our best breakfast burrito hunt."

    "reviews": "We went for lunch about 2:30 on a Saturday afternoon and they were doing a brisk business. All three of us got Pho and it was excellent. The medium bowl was too large for me and my daughter-in-law so we got to go containers but my son finished his. The menu offers lots of choices so when we come back I might try something else. The servers were pleasant and the food arrived quickly. They were attentive about refilling our water, which was much appreciated. After being seated, I had to wait pretty long to order. There were only 2 other tables and the folks were already eating. In fact, bigger groups entering after me got quicker service than I did. The food itself was average. The fish sauce it came with lacked flavor and I had to use alot of it. The biggest red flag was the cleanliness. They had brooms and dust pans next to the booths. If you don't believe me walk up to their counter and look at the dirt in front of the kitchen door. If you\u2019re looking for the best pho in town, look no further! From the moment I walked in, I was greeted with warm hospitality and seated right away. The staff here goes above and beyond to make you feel welcome, ensuring your experience is nothing short of exceptional.\n\nNow, let\u2019s talk about the food\u2014absolutely incredible! The broth is rich, flavorful, and perfectly balanced, with that deep, slow-simmered taste that only true pho masters can achieve. The meat was tender and high quality, and the fresh herbs, bean sprouts, and lime elevated every bite. They also offer a great selection of other Vietnamese dishes, each packed with authentic flavors and beautifully presented.\n\nService was quick, attentive, and friendly without feeling rushed. My drink was never empty, and they made sure everything was just right throughout the meal. You can tell they genuinely care about their customers.\n\nOverall, this place is a gem. Amazing food, top-tier service, and a welcoming atmosphere\u2014what more could you ask for? I\u2019ll definitely be back! The food was good.\nService was okay.\n\nRestaurant was clean. Hit or miss, so they are not very consistent. Sometimes the broth flavorless, sometimes great, sometimes too oily. Don\u2019t provide a lot of meat. Service is great. I\u2019ve been coming here for 20 years"

    "reviews": "My new fave in this area!!! The decor was super inviting and cute when we came in. Cathy, our waitress, was so friendly & professional. The food was fresh & flavorful. We had 3 adults & 3 kids. They were totally accommodating. Our order came out accurate & fresh. You can tell their food isn't microwaved. The salsa is perfect & the green chili is some of the best I've had in this state. I came during a happy hour and the house margs were only $5 so I got one of those and wanted to try the FLAMING PINEAPPLE Mezcal Marg & it literally came out then they lit it on fire. It was super cool and absolutely DELISH. Jasmine & Cathy were super amazing as waitresses. They took the time to answer my questions about the Mezcal and it all made our experience even better. I highly recommend this spot. Sad story true zero stars if possible waited 5 minutes to sit. 15 minutes to take our drink order alcohol underaged it's ok no I'd required. 30 minutes for chips and salsa 45 minutes to take your order. No problem tip my behind lol \ud83d\ude06.  Don't want compensation I paid the price just warning future clients. I used to run the Goodtimes across the street go there instead. Cheaper and better. Quicker. And to end it I'm Mexican but server can't take an order right. Just warning \u26a0\ufe0f  Can't believe Service wait what service. pH haha. Possibly all the good reviews are underage people that get alcohol lol. No wonder great reviews. Westminster broomfiel investigate. The atmosphere is so, warm, cozy, fun and \u201cold school!\u201d So many restaurants are losing their character by remodeling into white and bright lights. Coronas feels like \u201ccoming home,\u201d or reliving the times when families would go out for Mexican and feel immersed in the culture!\n\nEvery staff member we encountered was welcoming, genuinely friendly, helpful, knowledgeable and efficient. Nice people with kind smiles.\n\nI had a blackberry margarita and it was amazing!! It had a lovely/full  blackberry taste and was made perfectly!\n\nOur four different dinner plates were excellent. Thoughtfully made and presented, along with good portions.\n\nI\u2019m looking forward to going back! Thank you for \u201ckeeping it real!\u201d LOVEEE. I went in the other day with my girls for a few drinks at the bar and we had the most amazing service provided ever by a lovely girl named Alexis. She made us feel comfortable, we got greeted right away and definitely loved how sweet, and friendly she was!! Suggested a few drinks that we definitely loved with great food provided and we highly recommend going to the bar area and ask for a girl named Alexis ! Top notch service from her! 100/10 We hosted a baby shower in their private room and it was terrific! We did a nacho bar and it had every topping you'd want on your nachos.  Room was spacious. Misty was great to work with."

Applebee\u2019s has become a go to restaurant, when we don\u2019t know what we\u2019re hungry for. They have a wide variety on their menu and the food and service has always been very good. This made me realize we don't got to Apple bees as often as we should. I can't remember the names of the plates. All really good though. Great server, his name was Rick I think \ud83e\udd14 Very average restaurant experience,  but the waiter was excellent.\nHad a chocolate shake and fries and both seemed smaller at a higher price.\nUnfortunately,  that complaint applies to restaurants' pricing, in general.  Increase covers rising costs while adding extra cost to increase profits. Staff is friendly. Was really happy with the quality of food. Crispy taco appetizers.  Loved the walnuts in the wedge salad. Chicken wings were also satisfying.  Would get a 5 star but our server disappeared after our bill was paid.  Slower during lunch hour. Outstanding Food and Service today on July 4th!!! Taylor our Waiter was Amazing very attentive to every detail, friendly and efficient! Other servers could learn something from him! Highly Recommend!!"

    "reviews": "I ended up getting a small and a medium hot drink, when I got home I noticed they were lighter then usually, went to open them and barely had any drink in both. Ended up adding milk and coffee myself at home defeating the whole purpose or getting a drink. The service was great when ordering but if I\u2019m paying for a drink I want it to at least be full and not with 4 sips of drink. This is not the first time it\u2019s happened and I\u2019ve given the workers the benefit of the doubt and I don\u2019t like to complain but it\u2019s been too many time! Crew members are always super polite, even when they have a long line! As someone who works in food service, it's difficult to keep positivity sometimes, but these guys are always great :) Every time I come here this can't get done right.   I try to be respectful and leave the window before checking but this is so common I feel it's intentional.\nNo cheese on a croissant.\nNo matter what shift... It can't get done right. Apologies aren't fixing simple yet incorrect orders... I've worked food service and I understand being busy but that isn't always the same atmosphere.\nAs a long time customer who has stepped away numerous times... I hope if I come back in the future something can be done about this, I'm sure the workers will read this since they watched me go to reviews. You're at work and I'm trying to get there... Time and gas reimbursement isn't included in my order. I stopped here to get some hot coffee for the start of our road trip because if you didn't know, \"America Runs on Dunkin'.\" We didn't order any of their specialty drinks, nor did we order any food - just the hot coffee with cream and sugar.\n\nThe employees working on 30 Aug 2023 were very friendly and prepared our coffee super fast. I've been to other Dunkin' locations where it took forever to get a simple hot coffee, which can be very frustrating; however, this wasn't the case here.\n\nThe biggest drawback I noticed of this location is the lack of cleanliness in the dining area and bathroom. Normally, I wouldn't highlight this as much, but since the restaurant was empty with very minimal customers in the drive-thru, I figured there shouldn't be an excuse. Additionally, I would recommend that this restaurant receive a little refreshing to it. I noticed tv's were hung up, but they weren't being utilized. Also, some of the decor/furniture looked a little dated - one table/chair set appeared to be a last-minute addition to the restaurant because it didn't match the other sets.\n\nOverall, I was satisfied with my coffee and customer service, but the facility itself needs some attention. The very nice lady with pink hair and glasses that works the drive thru always makes my drink right. She\u2019s very kind. My munchkins are always fresh when she\u2019s working too. This Dunkin is my favorite."

    "reviews": "Mom and I went to the restaurant on Memorial day and the restaurant was packed! Best servers ever Veronica and Victor  are amazing!! Best service, friendly atmosphere and the owner's son jumped right in to help. The service is the best hands down. Thank you for the amazing dining experience! It's a family-friendly place with a good atmosphere. What I liked most was the horchata water, it's spectacular. The food is good, but it's not 100 percent Mexican. The flavors aren't 100 percent authentic, they're Americanized. You can count on 3 Margaritas Westminster for consistent fast service, quality food, and a nice family friendly atmosphere everytime. I love the crispy chile relleno, and my friend always gets a combo plate with an enchilada, burrito, and relleno. Crispy chips and salsa are complimentary and we can get in and out of there in under an hour if we want. The restaurant is very large to accommodate groups and they always have TVs on showing sports. I eat Mexican food 3x a week, so I've been around to several Mexican spots in the Metro Area.. Had lunch with a friend, and I can positively say neither one of us will EVER go back to this location.  First, nobody speaks functional English. I'm talking very basic english.  Second, food took forever to get to the table, despite the fact that is was almost dead, on a Saturday afternoon.  Should have been our first clue.  When our food did arrive, my friend's seafood dish was basically inedible.  Tons of cream with bits of seafood floating around in it, and so rich, she couldn't eat it .  My small combo plate was tasteless, and ended up costing $25 for a ground beef taco, cheese enchilada, and plain bean burrito. Green chili, sour cream, and guac were extra. (Same dish, elsewhere is $12)\nBefore our lunch was over, we both had to sprint to the restroom several times, with stomach issues. We were fine before we ate.  I had a stomach ISSUES and diarrhea, for two days afterwards, as did my friend.  Ordering an extra meal to go at the end of our lunch was like pulling teeth.  Our waiter didn't stop to check on us ONCE.  We had to ask other employees to hunt him down, and it was as if we were interrupting him.  Groups of employees were standing around visiting because nobody was there!  The restaurant itself was rather threadbare, and shabby.  I will never return and will spread the word.  I've eaten at other locations of this chain, with better conditions, but I doubt I'll visit ANY OTHER LOCATIONS, either, going forward. Too many other Mexican restaurants that have better service, better food, and better service.  This is the worst dining experience I've had for years.  Beware!!!! The chicken tortilla soup is incredible! They have pretty good margaritas and their happy hour is priced well. You can they make their salsa because sometimes it\u2019s a little hotter depending on the jalape\u00f1os that are in season, we really love that.\nAlways welcomed with a smile and treated well!"

Stood at counter looking at my complete order for a very long wait while manager and other worker chatting with only a few people sitting at bar.  Otherwise dead.  Cooks looked at me and ignored me.  Finally after walking up to the bar being ignored, went around counter and grabbed my own food.  That got the managers attention\u2026asking me if that\u2019s my pizza several times as if thats not obvious enough.   Telling me that I\u2019m \u201cbreaching security\u201d and that I can never return to the store (GOOD).   Sure, but never in 1 million years would I have done this if there wasn\u2019t such a HUGE LACK of customer service. They didn\u2019t even cut the pizza. Food was cold (for some reason) and the garlic  wings burnt.  Somehow received a email saying thanks for my feedback which I never gave.  This is not the first review for the total lack of customer being helped. Customer service was perfect super friendly as soon as we walked in the door. The food was so fresh and hot. We loved the wide open atmosphere with the patio doors, open and all the tables were nice and clean. We will be back thank you I was very hungry and called in moments notice for wings. They had it ready in record time. Sarah was cheerful and also professional  in attending to me. I've done service for s while and I just want to be appreciative of the team here. This pizza establishment consistently delivers exceptional quality and taste.  The ingredients are always fresh and the crust is perfectly cooked.  Service is prompt and friendly, making for a pleasant dining experience.  The variety of toppings and specialty pizzas caters to diverse preferences.  I highly recommend this pizza place for a satisfying meal. Today is fourth of July and there was big orders being filled and my order of only one pizza was treated as top priority and I am very thankful for the awesome guys at our favorite Marcos pizza. Great customer service. Thank you."

One of the owners, Parker was there expediting the food and obviously interacting with customers. He noticed my boys and asked to take them away. From there they were all smiles and had an exciting tour of the establishment. I am so thankful and happy. They just love Parker. Thank you for a wonderful evening!! Services was horrible, the wait time between check ins was over 15 mins or more each time, the servers attitude was nasty, unfriendly and uninviting.\nFood was dry, bland and just not tasty at all. Very sad because I was looking forward to a great dinner. Benjamin, was awesome tonight on Valentine's night. The food was amazing and delicious!\nThank you for all that works so hard to make this night. So wonderful to so many.\n\nThank you again Benjamin\nfor all the laughs and great service.\n\nWe have always loved Carrabba's it has been one of our favorite places to visit and eat such delicious food. Thank you thank you thank you.\n\nWe love their zucchini! Fritz and chicken marsala it is sooooo good \ud83e\udd24 \ud83d\udc9c We want to complement our server Chris. He was very courteous and attentive. The food was very good and his recommendations were appreciated. He also acknowledged our anniversary and was gracious. We will be back!"

    "reviews": "Medium lemonade No Ice looks like when you remove the lemonade. Cashier told me they'd have to dump out the whole lemonade when I asked for it to be fixed. If I wasn't so tired, I wouldn't have been guilted into keeping it. So, their soda always tastes like crap because all flavors come from one spout head and they must not clean them because whatever you order to drink tastes like 50 flavors all mixed into one. Which tastes like crap. When I order a soda, I want the flavor I asked for. Not some hideous monstrosity of all flavors. Please fix. Thanks. I had an absolutely terrible experience with the service. I placed a mobile order and arrived to pick it up, only to find that the manager and staff had closed before the scheduled hours. They informed me that the food was unavailable and were disrespectful throughout the interaction. Not only did they refuse to issue a refund for the payment charged to my account, but they also claimed it was not their problem. There was no solution offered, and this level of service is completely unacceptable. Not open for posted hours.  Wish there was a firey hole in the ground instead of this Wendy's.  Then I wouldn't be able to delude myself into believing I could get the same honest meal here as I can at every other Wendy's in the area. Literally will never come back to this Wendy\u2019s location. Old nuggets, fries and was handed the wrong drink after saying loud and clear I did t want strawberry lemonade. This store is a joke."

The menu has changed a bit but they still have the old favorites like the chicken fried steak, pot roast and fried catfish. We also tried the new skillet cornbread.\n\nOur meals were good and the service was great. There are other new things on the menu that we may want to go back and try if we happen to be close to one. Waitress was good. Young and with purple hair. She was very good. The Mgr never asked how everything was. Had a nice experience. The baked squash was okay. It's a lot better at a different location. Couldn't tell you how excited we were to see the Black eyed pea restaurant.  My wife and I have great memories dining at Black eyed peas in Texas years ago.We ordered the meatloaf green beans and red beans and rice.  And of course, we had to order the colossal sized rolls with butter and honey. Service was fast and the food was absolutely heavenly!  Team Sunday at Black eyed peas in Westminster thank you for an excellent- excellent experience! Came here for a thanksgiving lunch. the staff  was able to seat us quickly and were very nice throughout our dining. Food was very good and the price was very reasonable for the large portion we received.  Overall a great experience. I would be happy to return here given the chance. Looked forward to Chicken Fried chicken w/Jalape\u00f1o gravy. They were out of Blue Moon.  The server was a little short (not friendly social).  Food was good, gravy was not as tasty. Overall prices were high and being out of Blue Moon well that is unacceptable. May be a long while before we return."

    "reviews": "Was waiting in line (an issue not normally present at Chipotle, due to the fast service pace, but there was only one kid working the line), and watched this other kid (probably 16, Hispanic) staring at some papers on the wall, before sneezing into his hand, wiping it on his shirt, and then playing on his phone while leaning against the wall, not washing his hands before helping customers (taking payment and grabbing chips). Absolutely horrendous food safety and customer service skills. The other kid, and the older woman (I'm assuming manager?) were very quick once they were both on the line though, portion sizes were good, and just a generally good experience.\n\nSmall aside as it didn't affect me, but they were completely out of fountain drinks. We would come here out of convenience. Hit or miss with the guacamole and portions. Today was the last straw for us. These $22 burritos are not worth it. They are tiny. The guacamole was absolutely disgusting looking  (brown and soupy). And there\u2019s attitude of you ask for more veggies or anything else. I placed an online order so my husband could quickly grab his lunch before heading to work. He gets there, shows them the confirmation number, and they tell him they have no record of the order. They didn\u2019t even bother to check further or offer to remake it\u2014just sent him away. I called customer service myself, and they found the order right away.\n\nThis wasn\u2019t just a small mistake\u2014it was a huge inconvenience. My husband works 12+ hour night shifts in the mountains where there\u2019s no access to food. That order was supposed to be his only meal for the night. Completely unacceptable and incredibly unprofessional. I just ordered a bowl at this location & there\u2019s a bug in my food. I had just opened the lid and saw it in there. Obviously it\u2019s all contaminated so I just wasted my money. I called the store about 15 minutes before close (I got it at about 10:30 \u2014 30 minutes before close) and I got sent to a bot so I couldn\u2019t call the store and ask them to remake the order. I was very hungry so I was going to just eat it right away but thank god I saw it. Yikes. I\u2019d think twice about ordering here & make sure to check your food for bugs.\n\nEdit: I was checked deeper & I saw another baby bug laying on the lettuce \u2026 Food was fine until I found a hunk of cheese in my bowl. I ate around it, not a huge deal. But I asked for a bowl without dairy and got quite a bit of shredded cheese along with this beast. Again, not a meal-ruiner but just kinda.. gross?"

It has grown, with multiple locations now.\n\nIf you are not sure what you like, or if you want the gamut, do the buffet. It's worth it!\n\nEverything I tried was excellent, especially the nan bread. Yum!\n\nThe saffron (yellow) rice was flavorful and cooked well.\n\nService was excellent, but also gave our party space and time to reminisce.\n\nIt deserves all of the accolades it has received.\n\nGreat place for a date, meeting with old friends or if you want to expand your tastebuds!\n\nAtmosphere is very authentic to their heritage and it enhances the dining experience.\n\nStaff was friendly, knowledgeable and helpful, including explaining menu items for friends with dietary restrictions (no dairy, beef, pork, etc.)\n\nPlenty of parking. We especially love getting dinner at Y&Y when it\u2019s cold and wintry out, but it\u2019s a great place to go all year round! So happy they opened up the buffet weeknights. Pretty much every buffet tray is highly crave worthy and keeps us coming back. The dessert is particularly delish, you must have the carrot pudding and fried banana balls. Staff is super friendly and I love that the restaurant is fairly quiet, you can actually have a conversation! Babita is a super sweet server and we love saying hi to her each time we go. Every visit to Yakin Yeti feels like coming home. The Himalayan-Tibetan vibes here are pure magic, and the food never misses. I even had a special request for Owner and Chef Dol, and he met me with nothing but genuine kindness and heart. The pumpkin beer? Next level\u2014seriously, don\u2019t miss it. I\u2019m basically a \u201cfrequent flier\u201d at this point.\nNamaste and much love to the whole Yakin Yeti family!\n\u2665\ufe0f\ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffc\u2665\ufe0f\ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffc\u2665\ufe0f\nCareBear approved Yak and Yeti has authentic and delicious flavor! Attention was wonderful. Very peaceful and relax place to eat indian/Nepalese food! Absolutely phenomenal! Yak & Yeti is a hidden gem in Westminster. The flavors are bold, authentic, and incredibly satisfying. Every dish we tried was packed with spices and cooked to perfection \u2014 especially the chicken and shrimp korma, which were both rich and flavorful without being overwhelming. The service was warm and welcoming, and the staff made sure we felt right at home. The ambiance is fun and inviting, making it perfect for both casual dinners and special nights out. Highly recommend this place to anyone craving truly authentic Indian cuisine. We\u2019ll definitely be coming back!"

We stopped in for pizza and were blown away\u2014not only was it delicious, but you can tell they put real care into the ingredients and flavor. The crust was perfectly crisp, the toppings were fresh and generous, and it paired beautifully with their craft beer selection.\n\nWhat really made the experience stand out, though, was the fantastic service. The staff was attentive, friendly, and genuinely seemed happy to be there. It\u2019s always a pleasure when great food is matched with warm hospitality.\n\nOne of the most impressive parts of our visit was seeing how involved the owner is. You can tell she truly cares\u2014not just about the food and drink, but about the customers and the community. It\u2019s rare to find that kind of personal touch these days, and it makes a big difference.\n\nWe\u2019ll definitely be back soon. Highly recommend! This place is legit. The people here are super chill and friendly. I had the pleasure of being served by Lauren, who is an absolute rockstar. She's professional, friendly, and genuine, and I could totally hang out with her all the time.\n\nLauren suggested I try the Margarita Pizza, and let me tell you, it was off the charts. I devoured the whole thing myself, no shame. Great pizza and beer selection. We've been a number of times and only sat at the bar but the service is always friendly and fairly fast. Seems to be pretty family friendly at the tables and we've seen some fun musicians occasionally too.\n\nAbove all the pizza is really really good and keeps us coming back. Went with a coworker and his wife for pizza! We had double pepperoni, Hawaiian, and the carbonara and all 3 were really good (to my surprise). The Hawaiian and double pepperoni were my favorite. Their red sauce was really good, the \u201cgold bbq\u201d (mustard based) was HEAVENLY, the crusts on all of the pizza was both crisp and chewy in all the right spots and obviously made in house. The toppings were super fresh and overall the meal was amazing and a re-visit site for all 3 of us. Love this place!  The staff is very welcoming and prompt with service.  Very welcoming host staff from the minute you walk in the door.  We have received top notch service from all staff but especially Lauren, Trinity, Sally, Christine, Heather, Millie and Autumn.  We appreciate the variety of food and drinks at this local brewery.  We haven't found a place that compares."

    "reviews": "The least authentic Mexican food I\u2019ve have ever eaten. It\u2019s like a tourist went to Mexico and tried Mexican food and then without any real idea what they are doing opened a Mexican restaurant. The staff are super friendly and it\u2019s great environment to hang out but the Mexican food is not great. Pork tacos were ok and chile relleno I couldn\u2019t finish it was so bad. Probably a great place to go grab a drink but to eat Mexican food I would pass. Let me tell you about the absolute garbage excuse for a neighborhood bar where they apparently value the sticky residue on their tables more than the security and well-being of their patrons. I made the mistake of stopping in for a drink this evening and, admittedly foolishly, left my expensive AirPods on a picnic table outside for a mere five minutes while I stepped inside. When I returned, they were gone.\n\nYou would think, in a nearly empty bar with only FIVE OBVIOUS REGULARS present, and with SECURITY CAMERAS POINTING DIRECTLY AT THE PICNIC TABLES, that the staff might show even a sliver of concern or offer some assistance. You would be dead wrong.\n\nWhen I politely asked if they could please check the cameras, given the short timeframe and the limited number of people around, I was met with a cold, dismissive attitude and told to \"stop.\" The sheer audacity of their indifference is astounding. They clearly have zero interest in fostering a safe or trustworthy environment for their customers. The message was loud and clear: \"Your belongings are your problem, even when they disappear on our premises.\"\n\nThis isn't just about the cost of the headphones; it's about the principle. It's about the complete lack of responsibility and the utter disregard for a paying customer who was clearly distressed. In a true neighborhood bar, there's a sense of community and looking out for one another. It seems the only community they foster is one of apathy and \"not my problem.\"\n\nDo yourself a favor and take your business ANYWHERE else. This place clearly doesn't deserve it. They'd rather sweep your misfortune under the rug than lift a finger to help. I did an call ahead order. They accommodated the early pick up and the Burritos were fabulous! I ordered 7 Burritos with different meats. They were all delicious and the chili to meat, potatoes and egg ratio was perfect. Everyone loved them. They were absolutely delicious. I highly recommend this place. I will definitely be back! A little misleading, but the place is a pretty solid family vibe restaurant. Looks like a hole-in-the-wall type bar with all the black colors making the place darker than it needs to be, but it is actually a solid family restaurant.\n\nThe wait staff is also quite friendly and mellow. The food itself was done pretty quick. The breakfast burritos are pretty standard, but are done well and has an extra oomf when smothered. Fun neighborhood bar/mexican food place. People were friendly. Bartenders were always smiling and prrompt with drinks, prices were reasonable."

She is quick, efficient, friendly, and has a beautiful smile. She is on top of everything, which is rare nowadays. The food was delicious and we got sat quickly for lunch time. Salads and breadsticks are AMAZING! My only complaint is the lady hostess who gave us an attitude and was a bit snarky, but the gentleman host who took us to our table was friendly. If you come by, I recommend asking for Giselle, she is amazing!!! OlivevGarden never disappoints! Our waiter David was friendly and attentive. Restaurant wasn't crowded at the time we went and the food was delicious!!! Salad and bread sticks are always the best! Enjoyed a leisure meal, was clean and comfortable. I do miss the days of seeing ALL the tables full and PLENTY of good staff working. If you are looking for work, I bet they'd hire you!! \ud83d\ude09 Went in for a pick up order, gave the name and the employee gave me nothing but attuide (employee pictured) i would highly recommend avoiding this location. If you are here for polite people this is not it The online reservation is trash, dosent work properly & seems not to matter to the front desk, thay seat people in there order & take people off the reservation / waiting list. But the food & atmosphere is great. Most of the wait staff are friendly and fast service, helpful & check on u to see if u need anything else.. Worst Olive Garden experience we have had in recent memory. Took forever to get service that was then just barely acceptable. The Chicken and Gnocchi tasted and looked like some gnocchi thrown into some Zuppa broth. All of our food spent way too much time under the heat lamps. I think it would be worth while to drive further to a different location."

Then we had Alijah (Ally) as our server. Ally was absolutely amazing.  She answered questions and had recommendations which we took her up on. From the grilled pineapple margarita to the Brussels sprouts. My boyfriend got the porterhouse with the Brussels sprouts. I got the T Bone with a sweet potato.  Everything was delicious. Portions were huge. A must try is the fried mushrooms with their honey mustard. Wonderful.  Then got carrot cake which are 3 layers. Thank you Ally and Brandon for an amazing lunch. Great restaurant week offering, it's good way to try it out.\n\nFriday afternoon around 5 to 6 could be a bit rush and best to reserve seating ahead. It slow down after 6Pm though. They tend to make mistakes on orders when it is busy.\n\nSteak is their strong suit, the steaks temperature were right on. Very good steaks.\n\nIn general, the kitchen is good on preparing the steaks to showcase the cut with good control of temperature and time. The delivering to orders however is lacking behind especially under pressure.\n\nThe fired onion that came with the range rattler was very good, (much better than the range rattler). The range rattler wasn't up to the expectation, favors wasn't quit matching together.\n\nFried mushroom was better than the range rattler. Dinner Salad was better than soups and other options.\n\nThe quail upgrade is good option to take on. However the Brussels sprout was the current popular chatted method which not that great match to the rest of the dish.\nBread was great, the butter is a bit on the sweet side.\n\nChesscake  to finish the meal is good. Will have to come again, not during the restaurant week. Where the host sat us was the most inconvenient seats, felt a little blocked in, and a maze to get to and out of our seats. Our waiter was ok. Portion sizes were good for Restaurant week. I wouldn't recommend the chicken tortilla soup. Steak was a little thin. My fianc\u00e9 and I went here for Denver Restaurant week and let me tell you it was well worth it. Amazing food and excellent staff. The potato soup is out of this world, and both of our steaks were cooked to perfection. Shoutout to Diego for being super attentive and an all around awesome waiter. We\u2019ll be back! Great steakhouse.  Friendly staff that looks after you and makes sure you are taken care of.  The food was delicious and cooked perfectly.  The beer was delicious and cold.  I would recommend this place to anyone looking for a quality meal."

A speakeasy vibe, classic and modern cocktails, and movie nerds: what more could you want? Even if I'm not seeing a movie, I frequently just stop to see what new cocktails are on the menu. The staff are so excited about great drinks and great (or bad) movies, the experience is always awesome. Everything was wonderful! We love going to the TV Game Show every other Monday with Rion Evans Presents. Feels like I'm actually playing on TV. Service is terrible! Unless you are standing in front of a server or know them personally,  you can wait at least 10-15 minutes for a drink before a movie [better bet is to go into theater, sit and get a drink. It will come faster]. They need a better system in place to serve everyone instead of just standing behind the bar. Who'd guess the best cocktail bar in Westminster is inside a movie theater? Nice place to chill\u2014esp before/after a movie\u2014though kinda barebones so don't make it your whole evening. But there's trivia on Wednesdays and the occasional drag queen bingo! Drinks are affordable (compared to downtown) but food is kinda pricey. Pizzas are awesome!"

Over the weekend we tried it for the first time and let me tell you their slogan \"You've tried the rest, now try the best\" is 100% accurate! The pizza is delicious!! We got a vegetarian with a Silverado stuffed crust and it was perfect! Topping were plentiful, topping to cheese ratio was on point, and they dust the crust with garlic salt. This is our only pizza spot from here on out! I ordered the Hawaiian stuffed crust via DoorDash and this pizza was absolutely beautiful and delicious. Excellent cheese coverage. My new go to from here on out! Ordered off DoorDash, went to pick it up - deep dish pepperoni was super light on toppings, crust was overdone, overall very forgettable, churros were probably frozen and overdone.

The food was well beyond expectations and is one of the many things that will keep us coming back! The main thing is the hospitality and customer appreciation. If you're looking for a new local spot with great food, music and hospitality then this is your pick! Love this place, and the man Mesut, who loves running the Aspen Lodge Bar & Grill. Literally a daily event, The Apsen L,B&G has a spectacular decorum, which is right up my Christmas alley. All the sparkle and magical glitter with an amazing ensemble of Iron Maden dancing in your ears! The food, drinks, atmosphere, and especially the employees are dedicated to their clientele. We felt at home when the smiling greeter Mesut showed us to our table. Wow, what a beautiful place to visit, eat, drink, and make lasting memories. They go above and beyond by providing lasting experience. A family friendly Christmas / Iron Maiden bar with amazing food, What more could you ask for?\n\nThe staff delivered fast, friendly service, seating us quickly amid tinsel and vintage stereo equipment. The owner\u2019s personal check-in added a warm touch, and the music was kept at a kid-friendly volume, making it easy to enjoy the quirky atmosphere.\n\nThe food was a knockout. The cheesesteaks were juicy, cheesy perfection, paired with crispy, addictive fries. Folks also loved the gyro plate and the dolma appetizers we ordered.  We are definitely adding this place to our main restaurant rotation! Believe the hype- Ditto to all the other 5 star reviews.  this Place is great.\nI've had a lot of great cheese steaks and this one is right up there.\nGreat food, service and value, thank you E. My dad and I went earlier today for the first time and we were pleasantly surprised. First of all the staff are so friendly, the chef came and talked to us so that was cool, they really make you feel welcomed, there good people . We started with the Jalape\u00f1o poppers, then I got the steak platter and he got the chicken platter they were both delicious and the pita is sooo good!!!"

The fried perogies are probably the best I've ever had, sorry Nona. It may be a small restaurant in a strip mall, but once you enter the atmosphere and food are fantastic. Our table ordered beet soup, potato dumplings, cabbage rolls, and grilled sausage. Everything was so delicious and so flavorful that we devoured everything. The chef came out and told us the history of the couple that own the restaurant and also where the food comes from and how they grind their own sausage meat. We greatly enjoyed our dinner and highly recommend this place for an Eastern European experience. Hidden gem. Not many authentic Polish food around. I met my inlaws here for a late lunch and will go back when I'm in the area.\n\nTo be honest, the location in the strip mall isn't that appealing. That said, the inside is spacious, neat & clean. I couldn't decide what to get but went with the cabbage rolls (go\u013eabki) & mushroom sauce and virtually licked the plate clean. My great grandparents were from the Poland & Czechoslovakian area so we have recipes passed down I remember my grandma & mother making so this place stacks up!\n\nDon't be fooled by its outside appearance, if you want homemade Polish food, go here! My boyfriend and I decided to visit to try authentic polish food for our first time. The restaurant only had one other table when we walked in but the ambiance was calm and cozy. The waitress that helped us was very knowledgeable. We pointed out what categories we were interested in and she informed us what the best and popular dishes were in each category. I thoroughly enjoyed the service and the experience. Im not familiar with what polish food is supposed to taste like but it was good, the food was rich, savory, filling and presentation was beautiful. I forgot to get pictures of our entrees! Honestly, we were only here for dessert but I cannot wait to come back here and try more of their menu. Every single thing that came out of the kitchen smelled fabulous, and we got plenty of service and attention while sitting at the bar. We had the flourless chocolate torte and a flight of vodka, though that title of \u201cvodka\u201d doesn\u2019t do justice to the wonders that are their house-made flavored liquors that range from sweet to spice, herbal, floral, vegetable and fruit. Almost any flavor you can imagine. They sell full bottles here as well; a bottle of your favorite flavor would make an excellent gift.\n\nThis place is in an unassuming strip mall, but the interior is warm, comfortable, and softly lit. There\u2019s plenty of parking, the restrooms are well kept. My understanding is that this is still a family-run place, and it is a high-quality experience. Large and small tables, booths, and bar seating available. This place is a treasure that I hope will endure for a long time to come."

Not for the price/amount ratio\n\nEdit: when we got home we were so sad and what we got we ordered out taco bell. The chips we got at qdoba were stale and unsalted. Just really disappointing experience.  Especially for the price. Then having to pay to go somewhere else. Wish I read the reviews first. Apparently it's a pattern(last week post from a separate patron) This review is mostly about the customer service ~the two staff working today at noon were wonderful! Friendly, warm and so accommodating. When I ordered a substitution the woman who served me said, \u201cyou\u2019re the boss\u201d with a smile. It\u2019s sad that the sharpest customer service Ive experienced lately has been at a \u2018chain restaurant \u2018 but you know what\u2026I\u2019ll take it! Food was yummy too. Your employees deserve a raise \ud83d\ude0a\u2705 Props to the crew at this location. When I came in a series of small crisis's all happened simultaneously, none of which were the fault of anyone there. Yet in spite of this, my order was promptly made as soon as an ingredient was available while all other issues were simultaneously resolved. Frankly kinda awesome to witness!\n\nHonestly I've waited in lines longer than it took to get my food here in spite of the issues this time, I can only imagine how fast it would have been had things been going well! I\u2019m participating in the free entree on burrito day. I\u2019ve just got to say that it\u2019s busy as hell in here and these employees are killing it. I gave a tip with my online order but no matter how much I give, they aren\u2019t being paid enough! They are overwhelmed with people and online orders. It looks like even what appears to be the manager is helping out! I appreciate managers who jump in and seem to actually help out the employees. I hope that\u2019s the case here, because it\u2019s nice to see! Horrible service and communication between the cook and server. Waited twenty minutes and finally walked out  due to the lack of service or sense of urgency from the server, cashier and cook. Several other patrons behind me walked out as well. An older couple were ahead of me along with a young man who were still in line waiting for change when I drove past again after choosing Wendy\u2019s"

    "reviews": "We had an Outback gift card to use so stopped here on a weeknight. It wasn\u2019t crowded or loud, and the food was overall delicious. The tuna appetizer was refreshing. My filet mignon I felt was rare and not medium rare, and normally I would suck it up but I just wasn\u2019t feeling this and asked to cook it for a little longer. I received a new piece that was cooked closer to medium rare, but it also felt a lot smaller than the first piece.\n\nMy favorite of the night was not the steak, but the sweet potato side. I also really liked the extra mushrooms \u2014 just a note that there are a TON and there are onions in the sauce, which was great since I was initially caught between the mushrooms and the onions!\n\nWe tried the butter cake for the dessert and really enjoyed it.\n\nOverall, it was a great meal! Great food, tad pricy but it was worth it. My medium rare steak did come out raw, but they promptly took it back and made a new one, and it was fantastic. A great dinner experience. I had a fantastic experience at the Outback Steakhouse on Sheridan in Westminster! Our server, Bree, was absolutely wonderful\u2014friendly, attentive, and made sure everything was perfect throughout the meal. She went above and beyond to make us feel welcome and took the time to check in without being intrusive. The food was cooked just right (the steak was flavorful and tender!), and the service made the whole evening even better. If you\u2019re stopping by, definitely ask for Bree\u2014you\u2019ll be in great hands! Some of the worst service I\u2019ve ever experienced at this outback steakhouse location usually they are top-notch but today was much different. The steak was also very chewy. Usually, it\u2019s much more tender overall just a disappointment for a place that I visit several times a year. Also, the server never cleared any of the dishes and I had to ask for a refill on my water We had such a wonderful experience at Outback! Our server, Reid, was absolutely amazing. He remembered all of our preferences, and offered fantastic recommendations for our appetizers and main course. Everything was cooked perfectly, and tasted amazing. His kindness and attentiveness made our evening feel so special. We will definitely be back and request him."

    "reviews": "Paulie's Italian Grill is a memory from the old neighborhood. His mother Rachel was one of the owners in Lachuga. His gravy is fantastic. The food is of course great. My wife and cousin both ate all their meal with is unusual. I ordered more than I could eat since I knew the left overs would be just as good. My wife cannot have cheese and Paulie made his sauce without cheese just so she could enjoy it. The chocolate croissant was fabulous. If you want a suggestion on what to order, good luck. Order more than you can eat and take it home like I did. Keep in mind, this is a casual family place that does not serve alcohol and not an upscale restaurant. Love the food here. Nobody has 'gravy' (marinara) as good as this place, and Paulie and Joe always pay attention to ensure a fantastic meal is served. If you are open to it, Paulie will make a point of getting to know you, and you will forever forward be treated like family. While it can be a bit difficult to find, it is so worth it. Paulie\u2019s Italian grill is the real deal when you walk in you\u2019re greeted with the sounds of Sinatra and the smells of pasta fill the air. We went with the small bucket of pasta to go and it was a ton of food and the meatballs were delicious. The homemade noodles were a real treat and the amount of food easily fed my family of 5 for 38.00. Not only that, Paulie must of took a shine to my kids cause he gave them some cake to try free of charge and handed them some candy to go. The food was delicious the service was exquisite that atmosphere was desirable. So nice to have a new Italian restaurant with roots to place like Lechugas. All the old Italian places have closed in this neighborhood this is a welcomed addition and I will definitely be back. My kids even enjoyed the box that the food came in five stars hands down. Just tried it for the first time. Food was great, everyone was super friendly, I think we were the only ones in there that weren't regulars, but we probably will be soon. Garlic bread was so good. Kid got the hot stromboli and ate an impressive amount. The manicotti and the Cannoli were also to die for. 10/10 will definitely be back. Felt like I was visiting family. Very clean and friendly. The food was aaaaaamazing! We all had something different and shared. Everything was fresh and hot. They make a homemade Limoncello cake that is to die for. Grabbed 2 for the road, should have grabbed more, hehehe! We will be back. I highly recommend this place."

    "reviews": "Raw meat. Ordered so I could eat at work.  Raw , pink uncooked Raw. Called just to 411 and was immediately met with,  if you Called last night we could have done something. I'm locked in for a 12 hrs shift. Equipment is to loud for calling. But Thank You Wendy's for the raw meat. The manager was great. The people were great. They recommended things that I haven\u2019t tried for. Awesome Wendy\u2019s. Great job. I recently visited Wendy's and faced an issue with my order. I made two separate payments: one in cash for a single Biggie Bag, and the second by credit card for two Spicy Chicken Combo Meals and another Biggie Bag, totaling four drinks. Initially, I received six drinks before any food was handed out. Upon informing the staff member about the excess drinks, she instructed me to keep them and provided two different receipts.\n\nUpon reviewing my receipts at home, I discovered I was overcharged by $10 and had been given two extra Biggie Bags. I contacted the manager, who offered two options to rectify the error: either leaving my name for a food credit or receiving a refund\u2014$5 in cash and $5 credited back to my card. I chose the refund option and planned to visit that evening.\n\nWhen I arrived at the dining area, the staff were aware of the situation. An employee informed me that the manager was on the phone and would provide a $10 cash refund. However, the register only contained large bills. The employee then communicated with the manager via cell phone, who stated that I needed to return the extra food to receive the cash refund. This requirement had not been disclosed during our initial phone call.\n\nUltimately, the drive-thru attendant did not correctly process my order, and the manager failed to honor their commitment to a refund without additional stipulations. As my total purchase amounted to $47 across both receipts, I felt misled and insulted by the service received. Therefore, I strongly advise against visiting this establishment.\n\nBy the way the manager I initially spoke to was KD. Another perfectly good place ruined by a money grubbing corporation.\n\nAs of today the drivethru is operated by AI. I could care less if the system works good or is efficient. If you choose not to support my local economy by hiring our workers, then I refuse to support you. Bye Wendy's. Some of the best food I've had from a Wendy's in awhile. the burger tasted fresh and wasn't over cooked like usual, the lettuce was fresh and crisp, the bacon was cooked well without being too crispy, and the fries were perfectly salted (instead of over salted like usual) & hot. The kiosks to order yourself even when paying cash made things more difficult than they needed to be and the tables were not too clean (even though they were not too busy). the restrooms were clean, probably because a code is needed to use them."

    "reviews": "The drive thru is slow but they park you to wait for your food order. Comes out within reasonable time. Food is fresh and hot. Concrete mixers are great. Very thick and creamy. I got the Oreo with cheesecake pieces. It was delicious. My kids got the cookie dough flavor which they both ate rather quickly and were happy. I recommend them for food or a dessert. Prices are a little high but the quality is great. Inside is nice with plenty of seating. Baby high chairs also avail.  Bathroom was clean. Staff was fairly friendly. I will be back for another dessert soon. Thanks guys. We haven't eaten at this location in a while and we stopped to eat Monday evening and it was such a terrible experience. There was a young man on his phone behind the counter that didn't even acknowledge us, the young lady from the drive thru came over to take our order. The drink and condiment station was filthy. We have never seen the restaurant in such disarray. We took a seat after we ordered. There were several young male employees seated nearby in booths heckling one another, being loud and obnoxious, using vulgar language. Then when our food came out the young man that brought it out just tossed the tray onto the table and walked away. My husband and I decided we would speak with the manager on our way out to voice our concerns. During our meal two of the young men started tossing ice over the booth. I got up and told them I didn't appreciate them throwing ice. One of the boys apologized and the other looked at me and said, \"what??\" and laughed. So this behavior upset my husband and he went to speak with the manager immediately.  Another employee came out and told the boys that the manager wanted to speak to them, they didn't acknowledge or get up to go see the manager, they stayed in the booth laughing. The Manager finally came out and meekly told them to keep it down and to stop cussing. They had absolutely no respect for the manager and she in fact seemed intimidated by them. As we left the restaurant the same male laughed and taunted us on our way out saying, \"what?? I can't hear you!\",  \"you think I am being disrespectful??\" I cannot believe the behavior allowed and tolerated by this restaurant. I called the next day and asked to speak with the Store Manager. A gentleman came to the phone and I asked if he was the Store Manager and he said no, that he was a shift manager. He stated that Miguel is the Store Manager and he was not available so he took my name and number and said he'd call me back. Never heard from him. I hope that the owner sees this and contacts me and looks into the people they have staffed at their restaurant. Unbelievably disappointed.\n\nI did share my feedback at contactculvers.com before I left this review. I asked to be contacted and I have yet to hear back from anyone! Customized take home pints of custard are a really great option to have on any type of day ur having good or bad a lot of options to choose from for a great price! Would recommend there custard is really delicious as well as there other menu items would recommend the buffalo chicken tenders, chili cheese fries and the spicy chicken sandwich!! Would definitely enjoy returning to this location or any other one. 8/10 Thanks for the great service! Don't drive through or do curbside pick up until you check your order. I can't tell you how many times I didn't do that and when we got home a portion of our meal was missing.  The main dish, whether it was 3 pieces of fish or burgers, if you don't check your bag you could be sorry. For a fast food restaurant, this was very good. The kids' meal came with a coupon for a small ice cream. The meat was all very fresh, and the cheese curds were a treat as well. Fries were very fresh and they  you a lot of options for the sandwiches"

Thank you so much for making our experience a great one. Will definitely stop by again during our next visit to Colorado. Everything was perfect.  All local beer was on tap, unique menu options, and all employees were polite and helpful.  The food is delicious and reasonably priced. Tillers was a great place to stop! For food and drinks . Abriana was very helpful, attentive. Thank you to chef Ryan for welcoming us & recommending the super crispy wings !! Highly recommend This place. Ordered to-go from the restaurant and enjoyed it back in my hotel room. I got the wagyu burger and dry rub chicken wings\u2014both were fantastic! The portions were perfect, and the taste was amazing. The burger was juicy and flavorful, and the wings had just the right amount of seasoning. The packaging was well thought out and kept everything fresh and intact. Service was great too; they got the order ready quickly and made sure it was packed up perfectly. Highly recommend if you\u2019re staying nearby! Came here for Restaurant week and had a delicious meal. The chef prepared everything beautifully. We arrived right at opening and our server Abriana effortlessly handled both the bar and the restaurant singlehandedly. While she did so, she also went above and beyond in service.

    "reviews": "I am beginning to see why fast food joints feel like they're on their way out. Cause this Wendy's is lacking like many other places before it.\n\nThe place was kept pretty clean, though, so they get points for that. Outside that, I am willing to bet the food I ordered was just sitting back there since the lunch rush. It was lukewarm to a point I can taste the chill of the onion pretty clearly.\n\nAlso, it doesn't help that their value menus hardly contain any value, anymore. This Wendy's is an absolute joke. ..\nThe people from the 88th and Wadsworth store should come up and train this whole entire crew.\n\nI've never had a pathetic looking biscuits and gravy from 88th and Wadsworth look of this. Where is the gravy? Where is the sausage?\n\nThis crap tastes like it was made 2 hours ago Ordered a crispy spicy chicken through the drive thru. The customer service was not that great to begin with. Once I got home and took the first bite, something was off with the texture. I removed the chicken patty and cut it in half, and realized it was raw in the middle. I called the store, and a young man answered, and I informed him, he told me to wait a minute. Heard people laughing in the background of the call after he told them, and then a woman answered the phone. The lady was extremely rude and did not apologize for the inconvenience. On the contrary, she proceeded to yell at me over the phone for complaining about the service and the food. Got a horrible buffalo ranch sandwich instead of a spicy chicken sandwich. I\u2019m allergic to ranch. Luckily I didn\u2019t eat any otherwise there\u2019s the law suit pending. Idiots. Tried calling about 20 times, all to voicemail. Yall work at Wendy\u2019s it\u2019s not that hard. Get a real career or make a simple order right.\n\nEdit: went in and they\u2019re super nice and remaking it. Sadly had to drive back here, but something that could\u2019ve been really bad still needs to be obvious. That\u2019s a big change from spicy to extra spicy. Never hurts to make sure with anything. The employees are trying their best, but being out of chicken nuggets and three types of drinks after a 10-minute-PER-CAR wait is just insane. I have no idea who this manager is, but it's like they're face-down in a ditch somewhere and went \"oopy doopy peepol want foodz frum my ressran?\".\n\nI've sat in a line for a drink for half an hour. (No, I couldn't get out of line. If I could have reversed out I would have.)"

Gunther Toody\u2019s Diner in Northglenn is a fantastic spot for breakfast! I\u2019ve been coming here for a long time, and it never disappoints.

It was sizzling. I gave this place 5 stars before but not today. We were in there for lunch at 11:00 am. Food served was old and had to  be sent  back. All you can it ribs the meat was old and could not be cut it even with a knife because it would not peeling off the bone like it supposed to do. It was sent back. Caesar salad was sent back also because the dressing was  old and nasty. I guess the kitchen Staff like the cooks it seems that they didn't want to be there on Memorial Day !. I've been coming to this Applebee's for years. I've always brought my little dog in and a blanket for him to sit on. He's only 8 lb and perfectly behaved. A manager by the name of Juanita was extremely rude didn't even welcomed me and told me to put my dog on the floor. Never had a manager do that. My friend Christina and other employees always welcome my animal at this Applebee's probably won't be going to that Applebee's again because of that manager. Very rude and passive aggressive. I live close to the location on 120th and have been going there weekly, I'm a bit of a creature of habit. But I noticed this location on the way home so I tried it out. It turns out, you can actually get good service at Applebee's. I get Jen at the bar on Sundays and Mondays and absolutely love my experiences. I'll be here every week from now on, even though this location is farther from home. The service makes it totally worth it! Magnificent. I had the Bourbon Street medium rare, outstanding flavors. She had the Beef Neighborhood Nachos and Mucho Pina Colada. I'm going to make this the hot spot for family night. Jason, our server was awesome. Thank you"

    "reviews": "Ordered 100 wings for a birthday celebration last night and several of the wings we hot looked like this. Absolutely disgusting, I understand wings having one or two feathers but not like this. Also the lemon pepper one is extremely burnt. If someone spends $150+ you would think they would take the time to be like hey these wings don\u2019t look right, let me fix that. Lady working to go area had shitty attitude too. I walked in the restaurant at 910pm and had numerous employees including the hostess not offer any help. I waited near the register for 10min before placing my order online. The parking lot is near empty which is usually not the case for this location. I had a similar issue with the Westminster location on 72nd Federal proving poor customer or no customer service at all. I had a very pleasant experience at this location. I ordered the cauliflower wings & fresh guacamole with house tortilla chips, my food came quick &  everything was really good & the staff was friendly. So this might be the worse experience I\u2019ve experienced at BWW, the service was poor. We were a party of 4 , we felt abandoned, it took 45 mins for our food to come out , people who arrived after us got their food BEFORE US. When we did get our food it was cold! Only one plates were warm, one of them were fresh, ONLY because it took an additional 20 mins for the order of boneless wings to come out after the waiter said it give him 5 mins. Yet more everyone else\u2019s order still came out before his that had arrived after us. We finished our meal and still waited 20 more minutes before the waiter checked on us. He never checked on us or asked how the food was! I only paid for the meal because it never gave wait another 45 mins to get my food! Walked in and waited a while to be helped. This is every time we come to this location. Then we\u2019re told it\u2019s a 30-45 min wait even though there are plenty of open tables. Why be open and have tables if you can\u2019t use them. This is a service issue. We just went to a different location without any issues at the one off highway 7 in Brighton."

But the service was excellent Service was good, but they give you almost no meat. I spent more that 10 dollars, and I'm still hungry. Every time I go is less and less meat. Also, all the soda tastes bad, tap water overpowers the taste of soda, and all you taste is tap water. We almost never eat out because everything is so expensive so it was a very disappointing experience. What happened to the portions. They have way smaller portions with increasing prices. How are ur prices going up while you serve way less food??? Not worth going out anymore, this should be illegal but of course some how it's not Great employees,The gentleman with the glasses couldn't have been more helpful,And the cashier couldnt have been nicer.they were very polite,respectful, informative. And above all  welcoming. Great location with fast and efficient service. Not to mention the high quality in the food. Very much recommend to anyone and everyone looking for an amazing lunch! I just picked up my catering order and everything is amazing, the quality, the packaging. The guys that are working right now are amazing, super helpful and they were on time! Super Happy with everything."

    "reviews": "I ask for extra cheese so I guess they decided that I needed half the amount of fries and no extra cheese . And my chilly had onions but wasn't full and had no cheese... won't eat at this Wendy's again Food is decent. Never gotten an order of mine or gotten any bad food. Service is pretty good but they could definitely be a bit more cheerful. Never any \u201chave a nice day\u201d at the end. This Wendy\u2019s location has seriously gone downhill. The employees seem more focused on joking around and playing than actually doing their jobs. While having a good work environment is great, it shouldn\u2019t come at the expense of customer service. My order was incomplete and completely wrong, which is unacceptable, and the attitude I got from the lady at the window was very unnecessary as I was asking nicely for all the missing items. If they paid as much attention to taking orders correctly as they do to messing around, this place would run a lot smoother. The service was great. The chicken biscuit was good. The pull apart was hard as a rock, though! Couldn't even squeeze it, get a spoon in it, nothing. Maybe don't microwave them so long? Service was atrocious.  Ordered online and went in to pick up my food.  There was a lady working the counter and couldn't bother acknowledging me.  She worked on getting 2 orders out while I stood there.  After that she came and greeted the people who were standing there when I walked in.  She took there order and walked off again.  Didn't say a word to me, didn't say she'd be with me in a minute.  Then she was helping bag things for drive through and the people in front of me.  After I had been standing there for 5 minutes she came over to assist me.  HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE.  Being ignored is downright rude and horrible service.  Do not go in.  They don't care about you."

    "reviews": "Food was great and service was fast! We were starving when we arrived, so we really appreciated the quick service. We went around 5:00 PM and there were quite a few parking spaces and only 3 other groups were there at that time. Not as busy as I thought it would be, but that's probably because it was an early dinner.  We ordered the Combination Pho, Tofu Spring Rolls, and Tofu Fried Rice. They were all great! The Combination Pho had a lot of meat and good amounts of rice noodles and fresh vegetables. The taste was delicious. The Tofu Spring Rolls literally came out less than 5 minutes after we ordered it. The Spring Rolls with the peanut sauce was delicious, as well. Finally, our Tofu Fried Rice. This dish was good, but not as good as the other 2 we ordered. It was a generous portion with lots of tofu. The tofu was just fried, not seasoned, but the rice seasoning made up for it. We had leftovers at the end and our waitress packed it for us.  Overall, it was a delicious meal with quick and good service. I would eat here again. Not great. Took them 30 mins to get our combo appetizer to us and literally there was only 3 tables including ours. Others that came after got their appetizers and food while we just sat there. The pho was decent and the large was a lot of noodles. The eggrolls felt stale and chewy. For 3 to eat was 60 bucks. Rip off would not return bad service and value and not great. Disappointing as all these reviews say how wonderful this place is.... my dad and fiance literally left and got mcdonalds in the parking lot because they left feeling unsatisfied. Great food, fast service. Fantastic favor is this shopping center restaurant. We had an absolutely delightful experience at Vietnamese Cafe! The spring rolls were incredibly yummy, packed with fresh ingredients and bursting with flavor. The pho we ordered was outstanding\u2014big in size with generous portions and a variety of ingredients that made every bite enjoyable.\n\nA special shoutout to the owner and our server, Lynn, who were super friendly and welcoming. We arrived just 5 minutes before closing, yet they graciously allowed us to dine. We were so grateful for their kindness, especially since we were traveling and in desperate need of a nice bowl of noodle soup.\n\nThis turned out to be a fantastic choice for Vietnamese cuisine, and we couldn\u2019t have been happier with our decision. Highly recommended this restaurant. Our experience at Vietnamese Cafe was amazing. I ordered the jalape\u00f1o chicken with fried rice (rice is not extra but is not listed on the menu as included) and a mango boba tea. I enjoyed both and look forward to trying other dishes next time we visit!\n\nMy fianc\u00e9e ordered the lunch-portion curry chicken with hot and sour soup and a spring roll - she couldn\u2019t stop eating them they were so tasty! To me, their peanut sauce really stood out - it may take first place of all the ones we\u2019ve tried in Denver.\n\nOur friend who joined us ordered the pho and was very impressed too.\n\nLastly, the service we received was spectacular. Or waitress was so attentive and kind she boxed our food for us!\n\nWe are really looking forward to going back :)"

I really enjoyed my Mediterranean tacos, which were absolutely filled to the brim with tasty and healthy ingredients. I substituted the grains for a side house salad.\n\nWe didn\u2019t realize that you have to sit on a specific side of the restaurant to partake in happy hour, but our waiter was nice enough to let us participate even sitting on another side of the restaurant. Honestly, what a stupid and almost scammy policy. We had no idea the host didn\u2019t seat us on the correct side despite us clearly being there for happy hour since it was 4 p.m. on a weekday. No busy lunch hours me and my toddler were waiting 5+ min to be seated because no one was up front- the one worker that did come up grabbed their phone then left. We were visible to every other worker. Dough was undone and my order was half correct (missing items)\nIce cream is good tho\u2026. Got a couple drinks and a couple appetizers. The Queso had great flavor but was lukewarm. The sliders were a great option! They come with nothing on them and anything you add is up charge.  Their happy hour was nice, everything we got was happy hour. less than 40$ Always great, but the new soup and  salad alll you can eat is a no brainer deal. This place once again executed a trifecta of great food,  service and fantastic value. Shout out to the exceptional servers especially Tori and Krystalanne \ud83d\ude00 Fun sports restaurant. Wednesdays have Burger and fries for only 12 bucks. Fries are medium thickness. Their Brussels sprouts were quite good too.\n\nTasty espresso martini for 11 bucks.\nI've been a couple times and if you get Adam as your waiter you're in for a treat!"

    "reviews": "The atmosphere was wonderful bands that I was watching were great. I loved the burger with the green chili. It was moist and good and everything came out hot. The staff was very friendly. It wasn\u2019t too hot inside even though the music was on it wasn\u2019t so loud that you couldn\u2019t have a conversation which was also very nice I will definitely be going back and plan on spending a lot more time. Good food at a good price. My daughter especially loves the catfish. Appetizers are a must: don\u2019t miss the fried pickles and the roasted Brussels sprouts! Pizzas are also delicious! Friendly service. Fun atmosphere. Live music! It is loud, so not the best place to discuss heady topics, but if you want to eat, dance, and have a good time, don\u2019t miss The Stillery! Was super excited to try this place. But it was very over priced! $15 for the jalape\u00f1o cream cheese bacon wontons. And $18 for the pizza. Was not worth the money at all. The atmosphere was cool and there was live music. But not something I\u2019d recommend unless you like over priced good and drinks. Waitress complained to us about how busy it was. Then messed up ticket two times. After a movie, decided to stop in and check it out.  Totally impressed with the layout and atmosphere.  Lots of well-placed TV's for the games and a great stage for live music.  We just beat the crowd and seemed to be mostly reserved, so make reservations.  We enjoyed it and hope you do too! Just walking in, you already get that good vibe feeling.  Very friendly and happy staff, amazing food and  atmosphere.  Catfish and chips are amazing.   The third time in here in 2 weeks might tell you something.  Live music is a bonus for a girls' night out."

If you are a drinker they have tons of options for you. Overall it was a pleasant experience. We had fantastic  food & experience at this location of snooze. We were greeted  with a friendly smile, great music, and atmosphere  and seated immediately  even tho the place was packed. We chose  the bar where C3 & Squishy  took a phenomenal  care for us. They were extremely  attentive, kind , caring, and fun. Gave us some great suggestions. The food came out  fast, and portions  were more than enough.  We split the  breakfast burrito & habanero  fried rice. Enjoyed some housemate spiked  lattes and a seasonal  blood orange margarita.   Nat ( the supervisor) came to check  on use a few times to ensure  the  dining experience was great. It was one  of the best breakfast we ever  had. I absolutely loved it there. Highly recommended This was my first time at this location and I was happy with my visit! We came to eat here for a work meeting and it's probably the first time I've been sat immediately! Very happy with that!\n\nOur server took great care of us and was very attentive! The food was very good and I highly recommend getting the breakfast burrito and a latte or cappuccino! It wasn't too crowded, but busy enough, however the noise level was fine. Usually when this place gets really busy (at least the one down south) it can get very loud.\n\nOverall, I was very happy with my visit to this location! I still highly recommend checking/adding yourself to the Wait List either through Google Maps or via their website, especially during peak days/times! Had a great time at Snooze, with Joseph S as our waiter! I got Super Greens juice and the Garden Harvest Omelette (added bacon) because I needed some more greens in my diet and it was delicious. Joseph suggested the juice and helped me with the omelette, and was very attentive to our table. The portions felt generous, and it was nicely busy for 8:30am. Would come back for sure! Snooze NEVER disappoints. I\u2019ve loved the same thing for the past 10 years and don\u2019t think I\u2019ll ever be able to give it up. The Bella Benedict with crispy hashbrowns is my favorite. A side of crispy bacon is a bonus. And their coffee is delicious!"

    "reviews": "I had not been here in forever so I asked my boyfriend if he would like to celebrate our anniversary here and he had never been so it was a done deal. We had reservation on Saturday for dinner and we sat on the left side of the restaurant on a booth right by the kitchen. It was not as busy as I thought it would be so it was quiet and that was nice. Service all night was great, our server did amazing. We loved the Bang Bang Shrimp as I hoped/knew we would! My boyfriend ordered the Filet Thermidor Special for his entree and I ordered the Cod Imperial. I was between that or the Parmesan Custer Rainbow Trout or their Linguine Del Mar Special. It was good but a little salty for my taste. Better than my boyfriend steak. He ordered medium and was more medium rare. I didn\u2019t feel it has any flavor if you had a bite that didn\u2019t have any of the lobster and sauce. It was also just warm. For my sides I got asparagus and crispy potatoes. I appreciated the asparagus being steam and tasting like asparagus. Sometimes some places just add too much spices either too much butter or oil. They were cooked well too. The crispy potatoes were flavorful. Now, the drinks- yummy! The Coral Reef Punch was tasty- they did not have the dragon fruit margarita so I got a passion fruit one and it was amazing! If you like sweet. The Pomegranate martini was also good. I will eventually go back and try a different entree but get the shrimp appetizer and drinks! So good. The host station always sets the tone for the night.  AJ and Molly were super accommodating to me and my service dog and request for a specific kind of table that works better for us. Olivia our server was completely on point and the drinks and the meal were perfectly paced.  The only snafu was on me as I immediately spilled my delicious habanero martini. Met AJ again as he helped me clean it up. I had the bang bang, shrimp and lump crab chowder and hubby had the Aji tuna. Everything was beyond excellent. Everything was amazing! Got the new Wicked themed alcoholic drinks & both were delicious. The 1lb crab was so good, I got garlic herb potatoes & steamed asparagus as sides, no complaints I tore it all up. We got the Bang Bang shrimp as an appetizer & it was so delicious, would come back when I\u2019m back in town. The last things I got for dessert was the chocolate cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e and omgggg that\u2019s my new favorite dessert!!! However their dessert alcoholic beverages were very bitter to me (espresso and chocolate) but they gave me an extra cup of cream which made it easier to drink so other then those last drinks everything was perfect and my family and I loved it! Wow, we went to the new brunch item sampler event this past Sunday. It was amazing! The food was so delicious and the drinks were flowing. We had the shrimp and grits, the bang bang, shrimp, Eggs Benedict, and the French toast. Everything was superb and the portion sizes were generous. All the food and drinks were outstanding. We will definitely be back for brunch! The staff was amazing. I just can't say enough good things. Went there for my birthday and the food was TERRIBLE! The lobster was way overcooked and we would have sent it back but it took so long to get the order and we were so hungry that we just ate it. The table behind ours did send theirs back. The Bang Bang shrimp appetizer was a hot mess. Couldn't tell where the shrimp was in all that batter. The steak was tough and over cooked. For the amount of money they charge, I would expect better quality of food and definitely a chef that knows how to cook a lobster tail and steak. The waitress was very attentive and friendly. Food took forever to come out."

Nothing works here! Came here last night and legit at least 40-50% games were not working, not even exaggerating. Never seen so many reds anywhere, and even bunch of the greens just took your money and gave an error message on the screen. So frustrating. Two stars because the bartender was awesome. Wow the service is great! A little over the top I was starting to get a little annoyed hahah trying to watch the game and hearing \u201chow\u2019s everything.\u201d Every 5 seconds but that\u2019s show business. I can\u2019t blame them, it wasn\u2019t THAT bothersome. Lovely food, fun, loud atmosphere. We go here a lot. Loved Dave & Busters on New Years Day to celebrate my grandson's 5th birthday! We had so much fun, but the VR Godzilla game was the most awesome with Air Hockey & and driving right up there!! The best Dave and Busters that I have personally visited in Colorado! It\u2019s super spacious with a variety of different games that we haven\u2019t seen at any other arcade! There are games for different age groups that we all enjoyed! Once of the only downsides was that we did have to ask for a refund on our game card several times because we would swipe it, it would take the points off and then the game wouldn\u2019t play - and it happened with more than one game. Luckily the tech was very nice and always put the money back on our card and adjusted our points! He was however the only tech working on the arcade, the prize section and the food. We will definitely be coming back and had a great time!"

The thing I like most about BWW is their promotional offerings. We had a deal that was two sets of wings, two sides, and two fountain drinks for $20. Pair that with a free order of wings for my bday and we really had a great value meal.\nPlus it was pretty tasty. I preferred the wedges over the tots, and my favorite flavor was probably the spicy garlic, followed by the mango habanero and teriyaki.\nThe lemonade cocktail was sweet but good, and the pineapple mojito had a strong pineapple taste but wasn't anything special. We stopped in unplanned with a very large group of families from our soccer team to celebrate the end of our season. The staff was so accommodating and handled our large group with ease! The staff created the perfect area for us to all celebrate with adult and kid tables. Our food was quick and everything prepared perfectly. BWW was the best place for us to celebrate with our large group and we plan to go back! (And will give more heads up next time too) Why give customers the option to order a large or regular if you\u2019re gonna give them an extra small? To say that\u2019s a large is craaaaaazy. And this isn\u2019t on big back behavior either, this was supposed to be split between multiple people lol. Count your days BWW. \ud83d\ude02 Amazing Service! Very efficient! The boneless wings themselves transcend all that is deliciously believable!"

How does something like this even make it into a customer\u2019s meal? That means no one washed or checked the ingredients before serving them.\n\nIt\u2019s gross. It shows zero attention to hygiene, zero professionalism, and total laziness. I\u2019m honestly disgusted and won\u2019t be eating here again. This is basic food safety \u2014 and they failed miserably.\n\nAttached is the photo in case anyone thinks I\u2019m exaggerating. Do better. Did an online order around 9pm for a steak nacho and a create your own soup with chicken.  Once I got my order home to eat we quickly realized that the soup had absolutely no chicken whatsoever and the steak nachos had very little meat.  I know it was close to closing time but come on.  We will not order at this location again. I came here for rice bowl. They didn't have veg protein but have variety of vegie toppings. I had a veggie bowl with parmesan cheese & ice tea. I had a little language issue with the lady who took my order. But she made sure to make my bowl without meat as she learnt I am vegetarian. They have enough seating both indoor & outdoor. Food is great, service too. Out of all the Qdoba restaurants I have frequented, this one is the best. The guy prepping was on point, clean, and very courteous. The establishment itself was clean and maintained well. I will be back, even if I have to pass other Qdobas. Walked in around 2pm 6/5. I don\u2019t know if it was because of the language barrier but the lady working the front was rude as hell. She seemed annoyed throughout the whole interaction, was very short and was legit just slapping the food into the bowls. Also, they were out of a lot of stuff and I was given the very bottom of the white rice. Overall bad experience"

    "reviews": "The food was good, but the service was great. Our server Drea made us feel like family. We ordered Pomodoro Tortellaci which was good, and Truffle Mac & Cheese which was OK. We enjoyed our visit here and we'd be happy to return. Unfortunately make sure to check prices with the wait staff at this location. Some items are more expensive than the menu says, plus, even though the menu says \"side of soup, ceasar salad, or green salad with purchase of entree\", the salads are actually a $2 up charge and the soup is $5 and is charged as unlimited. We went today for mothers day and ordered 3 entrees. We were made aware of the $2 charge which didn't make sense and i honestly thought it was a mistake (its definitely on us for not questioning that) but we were not made aware of the $5 soup charge, nor that it was charged as unlimited (we were never asked if we wanted more soup, either so not sure how we were supposed to know that). The beers on tap and unlimited prices are also $0.50 more than on the menu given to us. Honestly $0.50 is not a big deal. I however am upset about the up charge on sides that according to the menu are supposed to be included with an entr\u00e9e. There may be more differences but those were the only ones that affected us. I know tariffs are hitting food pricing, but how can customers make informed decisions if they don't have access to the actual prices. Pictures of the menu provided are from this evening. The food was good. I had the Pollo caprese which was good but the portion for $19.5 felt lacking. My companions had the Mama's trio and said they both liked it ($26.5 each). The $5 side soup of tomato basil was good and the two $2 side salads were salads. It was nice and quiet when we went. (2pm) We received outstanding service all the way around and tried several different appetizers and pasta dishes. All were beautifully presented!!! The food is not as good as I remember.   We used to love the one in Oklahoma a long time ago.  The spaghetti was a little dry.  The russell sprout was good.  It could use dipping sauce or something as an appetizer. Wonderful experience.\n\nI\u2019m vegetarian, and they were kind enough to modify their chicken marsala in order to make a vegetarian dish and that is what is pictured. It turned out quite delicious.\n\nMy friend had the Signature Truffle Mac & Cheese, and I tried it myself, and if I had a large enough stomach I would\u2019ve also ordered one. Goodness gracious is that Mac and cheese good!!! But between my own vegetarian marsala, the antipasta pictured, and the bread, the tomato sol soup, it was actually a lot of food.\n\nI definitely recommend this location.\n\nOur servers name was Joe and he was incredibly courteous and is the one who recommended modification to any of the meat dishes that typically come with a side dish included (the pasta dishes don\u2019t, and I really wanted to try one of their side dishes).\n\nI had the cheesecake while my friend had the tiramisu. I eat a lot of cheesecake and can say this was quite good as well. The strawberry sauce was sweet but not like corn syrupy sweet, which I personally don\u2019t like and Im glad it had a natural flavor to it."

    "reviews": "If you're looking for a German beer experience in Denver, this spot delivers. While Prost Breweries seem to be the current Denver trend, with more on the horizon, this location offers a strictly German beer selection. I found the food surprisingly good and the service excellent. Personally, I prefer smaller, independent breweries, and Prost felt a bit too corporate for my taste. The beer was good, but the large, commercial atmosphere wouldn't make it a regular destination for me without a specific reason. Though my usual rating would be a 3-star, I'll give Prost a 4. Fantastic experience. The place is huge, the food tasty, and you can take a look at the factory. The sausages were great also. Recommended Prost Biergarten is the real deal for authentic German food and beer! Having been to Germany, I can say this place truly captures the experience. The flavors, atmosphere, and beer selection brought me right back. If you're craving genuine German vibes, this is the spot! \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50 Everything that I have ever had from here has been great, whether it's food or drinks. While the line can seem very long, they are super quick about getting orders in and out. There is plenty of indoor and outdoor seating.  Love when they have live music on the outdoor patio. We had so much fun here!! Beer was great, food was great. And no one cared that my kids weren't perfectly behaved and quiet. I will definitely go again!! We even took some to go!"

Unfortunately, the main course (a half rack of ribs), while tender, lacked flavor and was on the dry side. Honestly, if I hadn't been starving, I might have sent it back.\n\nWe also ran into issues with the payment terminal\u2014likely due to its outdated technology\u2014which made checkout a bit uncomfortable.\n\nOn the bright side, our server Samantha was absolutely fantastic: friendly, patient, and perfectly bilingual. A real standout member of the staff!\n\nI really hope they work on improving the food and refreshing the overall atmosphere, because with a bit of effort, this place could shine. 2nd visit within a span of a few months.\n\nWas very satisfied with my Charbroiled Chopped Steak during my 1st visit but, wanted to hold of rating after another visit.\n\nThis visit, I ordered:\nMushrooms as appetizer\nLoaded Tater Tots - 2nd appetizer\nand the Mushroom Burger as my meal.\nDidn't forget that superb Charbroiled Chopped Steak so, had an order to go.\n\n\ud83d\udc4d on everything I ordered and my other 3 companions were all praises of their choices as well (Chili Burger, Pork Chops and Chicken Fried Chicken).\n\nDefinitely,  a sure choice for a great meal.\n\nService is very warm, friendly and fast.\n\nOnly little thing was the lighting inside.  We went for lunch on both visits and it was hard to read the menu due to very dim lighting.\n\nStill, will be a repeat destination! I\u2019m in town for work and happened to see Black Eyed Pea while passing by on the freeway last night and decided to come in tonight for a quick dinner. Was greeted quickly by the host and sat at a booth.  Riley was our server and was fantastic.  He was friendly, personable and prompt. The rolls were hot and fresh, next time I\u2019ll be sure to get cornbread! I got a sandwich and fries and it was great, my coworker got the chicken friend chicken and raved over it.  We also got mozzarella sticks as an appetizer and they were so good!   Best of all, they had banana pudding and I was able to get it to go since I was full. I wish Black Eyed Pea had locations where I live in Utah because I would for sure be a regular customer.  Their menu is vast and has many options and choices.  Next time I\u2019m here I\u2019m going to have to try the meatloaf! I love this place. I've been coming here since I was a kid. The food is always amazing and hits the spot. The workers are super nice and quick!\n\nThe restaurant itself, even when busy, is pretty quiet and relaxing. The theme is cute and kinda rustic. It's always clean. Black Eye Pea hosted a group of eighteen, the food was good, our waitress ( Voilet) was amazing and did a great job getting all our drinks and food out in a timely manner. Usually with this large of a group it's pretty noisy and you can't  carry on a conversation but not here. It was a great time. Thank you for an amazing experience. Sandy"

    "reviews": "This is an excellent spot! It has a low-key bine and was great for a date! We had the Colorado burger and the Cobb salad, which were excellent. Not too far from the airport. An excellent spot to go with kids and a great experience! Update Feb 2025: Yummy food and awesome service.  Update Nov 2024: Still enjoy going here especially if I'm in the mood for sports.  Potato skins are still my favorite because they are basically potato halves and super delicious. I like some pico with them.  Original Review: We just moved to the area and this was our first trip to State House.  There's no doubt that we will be back. The bartender seemed responsible for too many people but she still stayed on top of our needs.  I didn't love my Buffalo Chicken Salad but it could be a different experience on a different day.  Romaine is so variable.  On this particular day it wasn't very green and therefore had very little flavor.  The potato skins were delicious and I really liked the mule.  I tasted my husband's chicken fried steak and it needed salt but otherwise was very good.  There is a broad variety on the menu.  I look forward to trying many more things. Beyond burger and sweet potato fries for my husband. For myself I got the beet salmon salad.\nService was awesome and the seating inside was pretty comfy and clean. The charcuterie board for the burger was quite awkward. Knowing how poorus these can be doesn't make me feel safe about contaminations from previous users. ***UPDATED 2 VISIT!!***\nI recently ordered takeout from State House Restaurant in Commerce City, and overall, it was a mixed experience. The  Chicken fried chicken was a HUGE  disappointment\u2014it was small (the same size as the chicken sandwich), burnt, and definitely not worth the $18 price tag. The sausage gravy that came with it was also extremely bland, which didn\u2019t help.\n\nThe Nashville chicken sandwich had potential, but the breading was poorly done, making it less enjoyable than expected. On the other hand, the Cheeseburger was nicely cooked, and the Cajun Wings were the highlight of the meal\u2014perfectly prepared and full of flavor! The side salad was fresh, and I really enjoyed the spicy blue cheese dressing. The fries and tots were also a nice touch to an otherwise mediocre meal.\n\nAs for the restaurant itself, the inside was very clean, and the manager was extremely friendly, which I appreciated. However, the front doors were surprisingly heavy, making it awkward to get in and out\u2014definitely something to keep in mind if you\u2019re carrying a big takeout order.\n\nOverall, it was a hit-or-miss experience. Some dishes were great, while others fell flat, especially given the price. I\u2019d consider giving them another try, but with different menu choices.\n\nREVIEW #1\nI think its better than a 3 but not quite a 4, but i gave it a four. State House 38 is a bar/tavern style restaurant. It has a nice full bar and a wide open layout. Lots of windows and high ceilings. Cool vintage Denver/Colorado decor and old photos. Food wise they have classic bar food that seems maybe a little elevated. We started with potato skins and a salad. The potato skins are thick and still have a good amount of potato in them. Topped with melted cheese and some bacon crumbles, they're just ok. The extra potato on the skin is a kind of dry and they taste pretty bland. They definitely needed salt and either sour cream or ranch to counteract the dryness. Salad was mixed greens with some red onion. Classic restaurant mistake where they put far too much salad on a little plate. Every bite knocks stuff off the plate onto the table. I had the special, The Above The Bar Burger. A burger topped with blackberry jam, bacon, green chili cream cheese and fried onions. Ordered medium and it came pretty close. A little over. The burger was good. The meat is bland and under seasoned and could have used some more of the jam. The fries were GREAT! Crispy on the outside and fluffy potato goodness on the inside! Well seasoned and very fresh tasting!  We also had the Reuben which was good, but barely has any meat on it. Definitely could have had at least doubled the meat and still not been overwhelming. About $70 for lunch which is about what it costs most places for 2 lunches, an appetizer and 2 non-alcoholic drinks. The service was great, she very attentive and quick to check in often. Worth a try at least. If I could give them negative stars I would. They forgot an entree and all the sides for our delivery order. When called they insisted it was the driver\u2019s fault that they had given the driver the missing entree. Does that mean he ate all the side dishes as well???? The manager was less than helpful and hung up in the middle of ending the conversation. Talk about unprofessional. Won\u2019t be going or ordering from here!!!!"

    "reviews": "There seemed to be only two employees (bartender and cook) and the bartender profusely apologized for the time it took to be served.  The bar was pretty full and most tables were taken so it was busy.\n\nHowever, it didn't take as long as expected so that was a pleasant surprise.\n\nWe started with the homemade chips and salsa.  The chips were warm and were really good.  We had the three pack of fish and vegetable taco with the shrimp Thai.  These were very flavorful.  We also had the three pack of cowboy tacos.   The tacos were pretty standard, but worth another visit.  They were filling without a lot of fluff. My husband and I ate here recently. Unfortunately it was horrible. We each got a few different tacos. Each different taco tasted exactly the same: bland and flavorless. Then we both had stomach aches for hours afterward. A disgrace. If you\u2019re serving food, step it up. Was excited to try this place, but seems like if you aren't ordering a drink the bartender doesn't want to take a food order. He was very chatty with everyone drinking, but said nothing to us. The food was very basic and the portions were small for the price. We won't be going back. It's probably a fun place for a beer, but didn't feel welcoming to a non drinker. More of a bar. The Colorado Burrito with the green chili was delicious and the portion was very fair. I really enjoyed the food here. If I am ever craving tacos or a burrito in Reunion I would come back here. Friendly family-owned business and a nice atmosphere. I\u2019d recommend it. We dropped by after signing a lease on a nearby home.  We currently live by a G's in Arvada and were excited to see a second location here.  The bartender Jake was awesome and I loved my tacos.  I always recommend the chips, salsa, queso and guacamole plate as a starter.  The queso is some of the best I've ever had and the chips are warm and yummy!"

    "reviews": "When someone orders a standard sausage egg and cheese and asks for it on a croissant with honey butter, I didn't ask for a sausage egg and SWISS. The cheese isn't even real it's this nasty liquid Swiss cheese sauce. Do better this is nasty. Normally don't have much of complaint at this location, some missing fries here and there but easily fixed. Today though half of my chicken sandwich was like chewing rubber. I physically couldn't bite hard enough into it to eat it. Would have took it back but I was never given a receipt and they slammed the windows in my face to fast for me even to ask for one. We went thru the drive up late at night on our way home from a very delayed flight.  Fries were not fresh and the burger was cooked to shoe leather status.  They gave us the wrong drinks and no straws.  To their credit however, they gave us the correct drinks and straws with a second pass by the window.  Staff was friendly, the food was terrible. This place is usually a hit or miss. Either they mess up the food, or the staff is just rude and makes it seem like you are forcing them to work there. Even when you order with DoorDash, dashers take forever to get your food because they don\u2019t make it on time, or they tell the dasher they don\u2019t have the order. I had the honor of being the first customer in the lobby. I was greeted very kindly by the staff and I was give a free frosty key chain. You have to order at a kiosk but the staff will make your food super fast. They also gave me a free piece of cake from the grand opening, it was delicious."

Completely disappointing Prices are AWESOME!\n~$5 for a breakfast sandwich/burrito, and ~$10 for a burger/sandwich/salad, this takes me back to the good old days and cannot be beat. I hope they don't change.\nI don't drink coffee so I cannot speak for their price/quality.\nAtmosphere is pleasant both outdoors and indoors.\nI never knew there was a restaurant in or near Westmoor Park, so  I think this is rather new. As someone who works here, I refuse to go anywhere further anymore.\nThe only other places with comparable prices/taste are fast food joints, so given literally any factor in comparison, I am married to this location for the foreseeable future. Quick grab and go in a business park.  Reasonable prices. Awesome lunch spot if you\u2019re needing a quick bite. Food is great, service is fast, and the owner is wonderful. Highly recommend! Uno at the bar is one of the friendliest and most personable people I have ever had the pleasure of meeting at a restaurant. I have been coming here for lunch while working nearby and the price, friendliness of the staff, and quality of the food cannot be beaten. If you work in the area this should be your go to lunch spot."

    "reviews": "What a hidden gem this restaurant is.  Everyone needs to try it, and you don't even have to be a golfer.  The young ladies working the breakfast and evening shifts are lovely people who are genuinely very friendly and attentive.  The chef in the back of the house is also excellent at what he or she creates.  We've had breakfasts here and happy hour dinners, and everything they offer is simply huge (and terribly delicious!!) for the price you pay, even the happy hour portions are well above average for the area.  In addition to the portions, everything we've ever ordered here has exceeded our expectations in terms of flavor, temperature, presentation, quality of ingredients, and how well/rare they were cooked.  Same can be said about the beers and wines we've had here, served at the right temps and all staff recommendations were perfect for our meals.  The ambiance of the restaurant is also fantastic, with a cabin feel when it isn't bustling with golfers.  We haven't been there on a busy night but we have no doubt it's a classy crowd and we can't see it being overly noisy due to the openness of the floorplan, table spacing, and ceiling height.  The patio would be great for a sunset drink or dinner but we normally opt for inside seating due to the wind gusts that sometimes roll across the flat Rocky Mountain Airport lands behind the restaurant.  There are also occasional wasps outside in case that bugs anyone reading this.  Love the little creek just beyond the patio too, so beautiful when it is flowing.  We're going to be back often as long as the Heritage Grill remains open, which do note they can close early if business is slow during the off-season. We are always looking for great outdoor space for a meal. The Heritage Grill is a fabulous place with wonderful food! There is expansive outdoor seating that is partially covered (so you can choose between shade & sun). The view of the mountains & golf course makes for a pleasant atmosphere. We had the Ceasar chicken wrap with kettle chips .. and it was delicious! Bayden was our server & she was simply amazing [attentive & friendly!] .. We will be back! Everything was great. the waitress could use a little work on being friendly Wow. I really enjoyed the BLT and sweet potato fries! Food selection is good and plenty of beers on tap. Low key good vibe here-I will be back! Limited to sandwiches and burgers, but very good.  Great for the golf course."

    "reviews": "Indulge in your favorite foods. Amazingly fantastic.  Wait was around 20 minutes on a busy Sunday. Everyone in our party loved this restaurant. Crepes, salads, seafood, pasta, pizza and more. Dessert was delicious. Service is great and the food is better than expected from a buffet. The first time was good enough that we went again the very next day. The pizza was great, the soup was awesome, the pastas are a wide selection of  cream and tomato based. There's a great selection of chicken, Italian sausage, and meatloaf. Honestly, just give it a shot and you won't be disappointed. First timer to Cinzetti's...and I gotta say I'm impressed. We all had a great time. We made a reservation for 4pm and when we arrived, the place was already packed, with a full lobby and people waiting outside. Fun, casual environment and lots of menu options. The food was very good and really good for the price too! I gotta say all you can eat good food for $23 is not bad! And our waitress was very nice. She was warm and engaging and kept our table clear. I would highly recommend Cinzetti's. This may be a new special occasion venue for us. They have so many varieties of food from fresh salad, soup, pasta, pizza and most favorite desserts. This place is huge and beautiful, has no wait time even with big party. Enjoyed and will be back again. Love this place. Service is amazing and food is great. $50.00 for two people for dinner. A small piece of Italy \ud83c\uddee\ud83c\uddf9 in Colorado."

Plenty of seating, and under the bar has the hooks for your purse which not every place does. Very clean and the music was not overly loud. We brought our pup and enjoyed the large dog friendly outdoor patio space. The staff was friendly and attentive and the food was delicious. I love the vibe here, cool staff and quick service, nice plate options and good quality meat! Great variety kids menu, and it's served with a little sundae! The Glenn is our local bar and grill and we love it!! We live down the street! We\u2019ve been coming here for the last 4 years and it\u2019s pretty much always consistent! The patty melts we had tonight were perfect. We love the fried pickles and green beans apps too. Delicious ranch and 1000 island. Staff is always friendly and they have welcoming vibes all around - definitely check it out. Came to this bar & grill near Irma Drive and East 112th Avenue in Northglenn (and hence the name of the restaurant) as a party of three for an early weeknight dinner. Casual atmosphere, friendly and attentive staff. Menu has a good variety of sandwiches, burgers, etc. and they have  specials, Happy Hour menu for drinks/appetizers, and events happening (trivia night, live music, etc.) on some nights during the week. Prices are reasonable and portions are generous. Plenty of seats/booths inside the restaurant, as well as an outside/back patio area with a separate bar and a good number of picnic table-style seating for nice weather days. Adjacent parking lot is free, but  might seem a bit cramped when the spots are all taken (as it was when we came). Overall, a good experience - recommended."

    "reviews": "Certainly the most accurate pub experience I've had outside the UK, and some of the best pub food I have had. When I walked in the atmosphere and aromas were exactly right.\n\nWe had the clam chowder, fish and chips, bangers and mash, and sticky toffee pudding. Each were stunning. The fry on the fish and chips is excellent, the clam chowder is smokey with a great bacon flavor, and the sticky toffee pudding is the light style with cr\u00e8me anglaise. Highly recommended each.\n\nThe service was top notch, even though we caught them during a lunch rush. We will be back to try everything else. Outstanding food with a welcoming and personalized atmosphere. The masala chips were incredible. We got great recommendations for whisky and food. I did not love being the two-top in the very center of things, but, this place is one of a kind. It is a pub that\u2019s meant to be warmly enjoyed. I took my Dad here while he was in town. He often visits London and enjoys their cuisine.\n\nWhen we got there they touted their fish and chips, stating that that it was \u201cfresh.\u201d My father was apprehensive - however, they did not disappoint! Light, fluffy, and served with delicious chips covered in coarse salt. \ud83d\ude0e\n\nHe was such a fan of their classic British pub fare that he wanted to return the following night to try another one of their dishes. Another favorite mentioned by our waitress was their Tikka Masala Curry. Apparently, their Old Speckled Hen bitter beer was delightful due to them having it on tap.\n\nWe were sat on their inner patio, where we observed that The Hilltop Inn, too, was a popular spot. Thankfully, the weather was beautiful and they allowed my dog to accompany us. He was a fan out their Scotch Egg. What an incredible find! The Shepherd's pie had a delicious earthy flavor to the ground lamb. If you don't like thst grassy flavor, the steak and mushroom pie in Shepherd's pie form was also delicious with chunks of sirloin. Loved the scotch egg. Kids meal fish and chips was loved by my 7 year old. Toffee cookie ice cream sandwich was also so yummy. The Guinness is nitro based and tastes extra creamy. Love me a pint. Can't wait to come back and try more dishes. Chris was great explaining the signature dishes. Ended up doing to signatures, fish & chips which was cooked to perfection, not dry, not oil soaked, just right. Fries are hand cut, crispy on the outside & soft in the middle. Their coffee cake is tasty & very moist with custard baked in then drizzled with Irish Cream & powdered sugar. A little pricey but for what you get & the portions it\u2019s worth it compared to other sit down places."

The is a great selection of Colorado beers (around 65) and several Colorado spirits, lots of TV's and we've never had an issue getting a TV changed to any particular event. Great stop to grab a beer and watch a game. They have a wide variety of local beers! Only downside is not having food but you can order from restaurants next door and they will deliver! No food other than a few prepackaged snacks, but there is a couple places no either side of this place to get meals to go and you can eat them inside the Colorado Keg House. Large selection of tasty adult libations, something for everyone so to speak. \ud83d\ude0a The selection was really great. Not only do they have a lot of beers, they have a lot of beers in each of the main styles. I ended up having a whiskey aged stout and a passion fruit milkshake ipa which were both very good. Additionally, there are select menu items from two different restaurants that are near. You can simply call in your order, and they'll walk it over to your seat in the Keg house. Great selection of beers - local, and otherwise. The staff is also very friendly and helpful. Overall, a good atmosphere to catch a game and try some different brews."

(Tried a latte here 3 separate times just in case the first one was a fluke but each time it\u2019s a truly horrible latte.) The turkey sandwich was fine and the ambience is nice. Ample parking. This place could be really good, but they can\u2019t keep workers. Lately there have been a couple people during the week who have been great but this weekend I went and they were training new people. No fault to these kids/young adults they\u2019re training.. whoever is training them is doing them a disservice. Nobody helped this guy when he was having trouble. Their customer service skills are non-existent. The owner needs to be more hands on here. It\u2019s just not going to work otherwise. My go-to place to work that is relaxed and has excellent food. The Hoisin Mac is amazing! My husband and I came here with a friend for ice cream, as it is one of our favorite ice cream places.  We love to bring our friends here to introduce them to it because their ice cream is soooo good!  They have the best chocolate chip cookie dough and raspberry ghost pepper ice cream ever!\n\nHowever it is very sad that Erica; the beautiful young lady behind the counter was having to working frantically trying to take care of 12 customers all by herself!  She was taking orders,  making sandwiches, specialty coffees, and scooping ice cream while manning the register all at the same time!  My heart broke for her and was frustrated for the other customers that were on their lunch break and having to wait unnecessarily.\nIt truly is not fair to her or to the customers either!!\n\nThis really is a fabulous place to eat. The food is amazing but if the management does not start staffing better, they may lose customers!\n\nUpdate - 1/1/25\nI am happy to say that today when my husband and I came back with my grandson to get ice cream, we saw that the management had employed more staff. Our service was much faster and everything was wonderful, I commend the management for taking my review into consideration and taking action upon it. We will definitely be back!!!  And I encourage others to come, try it !  11/10 rating. Arista Deli and Coffee has the most mouthwatering food, as shown on their website.\nAlthough I forgot to take photos of the food, I had barbecue pork on mac & cheese on curly q noodles. It was heavenly!\nI brought back most of it and reheated it.  It tasted amazing maybe even better than the first time, with all the flavors melting together.\nMy companion had a ham and cheese sandwich.\nOn their website, they have great photos of the food.\nI am most definitely returning because there are several dishes that look absolutely scrumptious!\nThe people are very helpful and friendly as well. Seating is not exactly intimate yet it still feels cozy. Even more cozy would equal 5 stars."

The food was great, and the service from our bartender Yannick was top-tier (this guy deserves a raise!). Plus, he whipped up some really tasty cocktails for me. It's a bit of an investment, but definitely a good spot for a fun night out every now and then. We decided to try this restaurant out for restaurant week, and it was awesome! The potato pancake was the star, but the veal schnitzel and apple strudel did not disappoint. We had the Prosecco that came with the restaurant week menu, but I will have to come back to try the wine. Our server was Hunter and the service was great. We will definitely be back. Great spot to gather with friends after work or a nice dinner. Menu has great options for both food and drinks. Very clean and the staff was so friendly. We had a party of 8 for work and they put us in a private room, very thoughtful & was an excellent layout. This was my second time at this restaurant. The first time I came for the wine and small plates, which were all amazing. However, I recently had dinner here this weekend and it was so mediocre. My friend and I spent close to $200 on the most mid food. So so disappointing. For the price, you would think it would be good but I feel no need to ever have dinner here again. I should have just gone to the restaurant next door. My dinner was not great, dessert was overwhelmingly sweet and neither of us could stomach it after a few bites. The menu is small but I was expecting actual good food. The atmosphere is also very 2003.\n\nMy friend had them add chicken to her salad and it cost just as much as the salad did \u2026 for three pieces of chicken \u2026\u2026 my chicken Marsala was extremely disappointing as well.\n\nIf you\u2019re into wine, they have a good selection but that\u2019s it. From the minute we arrived, we felt this nice European and chill atmosphere. A beautiful bar inside and a cute patio with a a good number a table outside. A nice red nappe on each table. A really nice and cultured staff. Spritz St-germain cocktail was like back in France. Delicious meal, perfect synergy of size, texture, not heavy. All of that for an affordable dinner. The only little point is maybe to put the music a little bit louder but W\u2019ll be back!"

    "reviews": "We live in Denver, were going to see Pigeons Playing Ping Pong in Boulder, so decided to check this place out for dinner before heading to Boulder.  Great decision.  First of all, I would like to complement Chow, our server.  He was energetic, welcoming, and efficient.  On Point, without a doubt, and did so while getting very busy while we were there.  He made our experience so much better, with energy and food and drink advice.  Thanks, Chow, and don't be shy about promoting this server, management!  We went there during Restaurant Week, so the portions in the pics might be less than what you typically would get, but that is to be expected for regular restaurant-goers.  The drink options were all over the board, and great.  My wife had a vodka drink that had hibiscus that was tasty, and I had a beer.  The food.  The wedge was delicious and a large portion for a starter.  Wife and I both LOVED the green goddess dressing.  Magical.  I got the lobster bisque, and it equaled the magicality (probably not a word) of her salad dressing.  It is in the style of less creamy, and more seafood-y (just letting the folks who expect creamy bisque), but I loved it.  Sad it was gone when I was done.  Wife got the steak, and it was great, but the mashed potatoes are what caught my attention.  The onion flavoring, the taste overall...was only sad because it wasn't on my side of the table.  My short ribs were incredible.  They were on a bed of polenta, and the sun-dried tomatoes added to the flavor flawlessly.  The desserts.  Wow, I loved my peanut butter thing.  I was warned that it was so rich that a couple bites might do me, but I ate a couple of bites, blinked, and it was...gone.  Loved it.  She got the Matcha-cheesecake item.  She loved it.  Not my style, but I recognize the brilliance of it for those types of people.  The atmosphere was nice, although we both had a little trouble with the WIFI.  Good.  It helped us stay away from the technology obstacles and we talked with each other more lol...  Maybe it was because we were the back table in the back room though.  But, that didn't diminish the experience nor my five-star review.  This review wouldn't be complete without a Seinfeld reference.  JERRY: \"But you yada yada'd over the best part.\"  ELAINE:  \"No, I mentioned the bisque.\"  I highly recommend, and we are jealous of you Broomfield residents that have this place in your back pocket.  We will be back, and see you there! I went for restaurant week and wow! So good. But outside of restaurant week, it is a bit out of my price range, but I really did enjoy myself. No complaints, and everything I had was great!\nThe New York strip was melt in the mouth.  Lobster bisque was different and wonderful. And a carrot dip. Plus, their bread and butter to top it off. First time out at Hickory & Ash. This spot has a great vibe on the inside. I found the place to be well decorated and everyone was friendly. I would say that all of the food was good, maybe a few things they could improve on.  They provided sourdough bread for the table, the butter was great, the bread was a bit dry and 5/10.  For our appetizer we started with the braised meatballs, great flavor and excellent with polenta 8.5/10. We also tried the carrot cashew dip with grilled pita. The pita was excellent and they were nice enough to bring us more. The dip was very good, had reminded me of a mild peanut butter and jelly 7.9/10.  We split the wedge salad, pretty straight forward, no thrills, a little on the plain side - but everything you would hope for a good salad 7/10. It felt like we waited a very long time for our entrees to come out, close to 30 minutes after we ordered.  The braised short rib with cheddar polenta was alright, it lacked a lot of flavor. Everything on the plate was cooked well, however two small pieces of short rib which needed better seasoning 6.5/10.  The stand out dish was the bourbon & coke pork chop, well cooked and had a great flavor. I personally thought the cabbage that they served it with would have been much better if it was not served cold. 8.5/10 on the dish as a whole as the pork was a little undercooked.  We also got the charred baby carrots 8/10 and the triple cooked fries which were pretty good 8.1/10. We finished up with a matcha cheesecake which was a great way to finish a meal 8/10.\n\nI look forward to coming back and trying more of the menu.  The place appeared to have a nice amount of people for a snowy Tuesday evening. Our server was very attentive and had quick recommendations.    Our appetizer came out fast but the bread was completely burnt. Which was unfortunate because the tartar was nice.  The short ribs were cooked well but seemed to lack in seasoning.  The atmosphere was inviting, and beautiful.  Thank you! Was looking for a nice place to eat and this place popped up.\n\nLove the atmosphere, upscale decor but laid back.\n\nI had the steak tartar, freaking really different and really good.  Then I had the lamb shank, tender fall off the bone, amazing!\n\nThe service was great, very attentive from the drinks to the overall service.\n\nWould I go here again, absolutely great place to eat by yourself at the bar or with friends or with work colleagues. I highly recommend it!"

Talk to your employees.. train them.. give people a discount or money back?\n\nI\u2019ve had pizza here before and it\u2019s been good\u2026 what the h is this? One or two pieces of pepperoni per pizza???? This is the last time I eat here. Too expensive to skip out on pepperoni. How cheap can you get? \u2026and the way they cut it?? Wow. The saddest pizza I ever had. The hawaiian and pepperoni pizza were very poor, no mozzarella just a different type of cheese that had nothing to do with the real cheese.. dry, small, insipid. Will never buy again pizza from Proto\u2019s. Ordered a cheese pizza to go got to the restaurant and a lady working just kept watching me stand there for 15+ minutes before I got to ask for my order and she was sitting there folding boxes watching me. When I got the pizza home half the crust was missing and the pizza was burnt for how expensive this pizza is I can\u2019t believe this is the quality you get could order dominos and get a better pizza. Family was very disappointed in the service and food we were unable to eat half the pizza because how burnt the bottom was we will be ordering else where from now on. We don't live nearby anymore but Protos kept us alive during the 2020 lockdown \u270a\ud83c\udffc Their building of the pizza castle literally made our whole week, we think about it often. Their pizza is always fresh and so yummy. The crust was a top 10 craving during my pregnancies and the staff were always SO friendly. We miss this place. Six of went, and we ordered a variety of pizza. Everyone really enjoyed their food. We also ordered a bottle of wine, and it was excellent. It went very well with the pizza. For dessert, we had to order the cannoli. Again, excellent! We will be back."

    "reviews": "Haven\u2019t been to Applebees in ages. It wasn\u2019t busy and they only were seating the bar.  The good came out hot and fresh. Staff was really nice. I had the orientalist chicken salad. Crispy chicken. Chicken over cooked but the salad is as good as I remember. The dressing is so good. Had a pasta dish with chicken shrimp and sausage too and it was good First time posting a negative review but don't want anyone else to deal with what we just did.\n\nThe Good: Our server was nice.\nYup that's it.\n\nThe seating host was acting like she couldn't hardly walk, but then as soon as she left we saw her walking down the sidewalk like nothing in the world could bother her, so was it just a sympathy act? Who knows.\n\nWe got a kids menu chalked full of activities! No crayons or anything for our kid to do the activities.\n\nWe asked for waters to start. They brought us water, not our kid. It's not like she's too young and she's sitting right there in the booth with us.\n\nWe asked for just a couple more minutes to look over the menu, our server didn't come back for at least 15 minutes. That's the longest couple minutes I've done in a while.\n\nOur food was terrible.\n\nWe ordered Pretzle Pub Sticks. Not only did they look nothing like the picture. I get they don't look like the pictures, but they were not even remotely close. They came with queso, and you could tell they had been waiting to be picked up for a while because the hard film from sitting too long had formed over the top when we got them.\n\nI ordered the mushrooms Swiss burger. Asked for medium. It was so beyond well done it was crispy. If you can't cook medium don't offer a choice on a burger.\n\nWife ordered the chicken quesadia salad. Quesadias were gross hard and cold. Salad was terrible and super salty.\n\nWe also ordered a $10 bucket \ud83e\udea3 alcoholic drink. Yes it comes in a bucket. There is absolutely no way it had alcohol in it. Get more of a damn buzz off a white claw.\n\nOverall the service was poor. We were there for an hour and a half from being seated to Finally being able to pay our check. Side note they have the little wireless readers for paying on the tables but they were all off, on top of that no QR code to just pay with your phone. So we had to sit and wait for our server to come back and pick up our card.\n\nOh, also the place is filthy. Dust on everything, lights (that are over your food), dust all over the window seals, and our table was sticky with what looked like maybe fingernail polish all over it. When I say sticky, you could pick your menu up off the table and it would make that rip sound.\n\nCost us $98 for 2 crap meals, and kids meal. The $98 includes the 18% tip we gave just giving the benefit of the doubt that maybe our server was new and that's why she was slow.\n\nIf this sounds like your kind of dining experience then have at it. We will not be back ever again. And wish we didn't pay $98 for what we got. Food was great serving sizes you can probably share a meal with someone and both be full. Cocktails came out quick and we're delicious. Business seemed kinda slow but made service good. Only issue was the first set of fries we got were cold but server was willing to get us new fries but seemed like the kitchen staff took their time because it took about 7 minutes even though the restaurant was slow. Otherwise great experience good location if you live near 120th. Service was quick, food was excellent and our server was friendly and attentive. I couldn\u2019t ask for more. Thanks for the trip down memory lane and the half price apps! I recommend coming here! We were seated moderately quickly by nice staff. A pleasant surprise was that there were Kid's Days on Wednesdays where a kid's meal is 99 cents. They served us our drinks first, then about 10 minutes later, appetizers. There was a pretty long wait to get our entrees, but the employees were kind and tried to be fast considering how busy it was. The food was delicious and a nice proportion. When it came time for dessert, they told us that their freezer had broke and they were debating whether or not to serve us the ice cream we ordered. They did serve the ice cream, which was half melted. I didn't think it was a big deal and they were very polite about it."

Possibly the best tandoori chicken I have ever eaten. Our host and waiter was hospitable and friendly. If I lived here, I would eat here often. Delicious! The samosa chat appetizer was amazing (and large enough for 4).\nSaag paneer as my main dish was flavorful and even better with garlic naan.\n\nService was great. Apparently the kitchen had an issue, but the staff communicated what was going on and our food came out in a reasonable time even though they said there might be a delay.\n\nWill go back again! A great spot for Indian or Nepalese food. The atmosphere of the restaurant is  very nice & clean. The customer  service is outstanding .The food was all served hot and delicious.\nThis venue is also perfect for every events as they have a big hall in restaurant featuring a stage, LED lighting, and a projector. Highly recommended!\nThe boss is very cool. Best Indian food I\u2019ve had in Colorado! I got the coconut curry and naan bread. The owner, Suman was very nice and gave me this drink masala chai which I intend to make at home. Looking forward to coming here again! Absolutely delicious, the real deal and Sonali was very pleasant and helpful. If you're looking for authentic Nepalese, this is the place to find it."

All of the wait staff are very friendly and professional; they always answer our questions kindly, without making us feel like we are stupid or inconveniencing them. Like others have mentioned, the atmosphere here is also quite pleasant and laid back. In short, if you love sushi/Japanese food, you must come here. The Sushi and Sashimi here are incredible.  Everything was fresh and delicious, and the presentation of the food is awesome.  We asked to talk to the chef to thank him and he was such a cool, friendly guy. Very nice place. Reasonably priced lunch menu. Quiet environment, I was able to get some work done and enjoy my sushi and fabulous green tea! Excellent food at great prices. Staff was very nice. It was me and my boyfriend's first time here and it was amazing! Our server and waitress were both super respectful, attentive and prompt. The establishment itself was cozy and nice.

There are other locations not far away. Go there.. Highly recommended. This Wendy's never disappoints always has fresh food and fast service. If I could I would give no star but I am forced to give one. I ordered 2 kids meals, both cheese burgers. They were on stale bread, over cooked hamburger and absolutely horrible. The French fries were cold and disgusting. I will never go back. Not worth complaining to the manager since she was incredibly rude!!!!!!!! They got my order wrong even after I corrected the guy at the drive thru about their current special. Bad customer service. Also they didn't give me a receipt just like other's have mentioned The night time crew used to be on point up until 2 weeks ago,  if you show up between 9:30 -10:30   your fries are going to be old and a good chance of them not giving you the right burger"

    "reviews": "I love the loaded Mac n cheese...it has delicious cheesy shells, pulled pork, and their yummy green chili. It's my go-to. The only suggestion I have is the soda they serve is so incredibly watered down, it's awful. I don't drink and I bring my kids here. It would be nice if they fixed the syrup level or served bottled colas etc. I get that it's a bar, but I've never been to a bar that served pop this low in syrup. Everything else is great here. Delicious bbq.\n\nFollow up to questions about soda:  We visited several times in the summer and the soda was always like that.  I asked someone there who said that they use less syrup since it's a bar and most drinks are mixed.  I assumed that meant either people want to taste the alcohol, or, they don't really care if there isn't enough syrup because the alcohol hides that. Went for dinner and it was a weird night because the Denver Nuggets game was on so the place was busy. We talked to some one possibly one of the owners and he told us order threw the app as we only have 3 people working tonight we're understaffed, you will get your food faster. So we order and while sitting there waiting and watching the older ladies sitting next to us said this is normal they are always understaffed. The owner brought us our drinks and then later we get our food. I ordered smoked wings 50/50 buffalo and plain with a side of smokes pork. Well when the food arrived I got 1 out of 10 wings plain the rest had buffalo sauce and not much sauce at that and no smoked pork. My daughter ordered extra ranch with here meal and didn't receive it and after we got our food no one ever came back to ask if we needed more drinks or how are food was or anything. Come time to pay the bill we look at the bill and even that wasn't right as they had not charged us for our drinks. We took that as a draw for not getting the correct food paid our bill and left. I think this place has great food but it definitely needs some work in other areas. I use to recommend people to go here but I will definitely think twice before making this recommendation again. Do better Oldman Great BBQ, friendly service, easy ordering system with table service. Back yard is huge and spacious. Only issue is you have to like metal/death metal/ screamo music as that's the only thing playing on touch tunes, and don't even think about playing your preferred music on touch tunes. I tried that and it was instantly replaced with about 50 metal songs. If metal isn't your thing, stay out back where it's harder to hear. Aside from that, everything was awesome. Great food and friendly staff in a pleasant environment. First warm Saturday of the year and the beer garden was packed. The staff were on fire and extremely attentive with everyone in the bar. Lexi is always friendly, quick and assertive, always ensuring all customers were taken care of in a timely manner. There was a slight wait as it was perfectly crowded, especially the patio, but the food was amazingly seasoned and delicious on arrival. The beer garden is super fun for your dogs and friends. I love The Old Man! Came in today for the brisket and ribs and wow!!!!\n\n1. The food was immaculate for how packed it was and it being such a nice day, the rush was crazy! However the food still came out amazing!\n\n2. The service was great! It was clearly packed so they handled everything pretty fast for as much volume they dealt with.\n\n3. The bartender was super welcoming and friendly, I believe it was alexis. She was nothing but positive and keeping us in the mood during this super nice day!\n\nGreat place!"

The food was so good (seriously, those apps disappeared fast), the vibe was relaxed and fun, and the staff made us feel right at home.\n\nBig shoutout to Chris the manager for being an absolute rockstar and making sure everything went off without a hitch, and to Julie the owner, thank you for welcoming us with open arms and supporting local women in business. You two made the night extra special!\n\nAlso, can we talk about that Felene vodka drink? So refreshing and seriously delicious!\n\nAlready looking forward to coming back. Highly recommend for your next gathering or just a great night out! Great service and great energy, loved Chris, Jake, and Audrey. They made such a welcoming impression and would come back any day!! The burgers were cooked exactly how we ordered and the flavor was more than we could imagine! Absolute exceptional service, our food came out super fast and met all of the expectations of a \u201cperfect burger!\u201d 10/10 would recommend the perfect burger and the charcuterie burger! You guys are awesome! keep up the great work team! Burger was very good, bun a little soggy. But it could have been the sauce.\nGreat fries, pickles and side salad. Service was good, friendly ! A mistake happened in the kitchen and our order came at different times but it was immediately communicated to us and it was resolved within a couple minutes; so, good hospitality! Honest communication is very important to me. A manager was present going from table to table to make sure things were good. Thanks. The Prime was well worth the extra cost of Wagu beef. I had it without the steak sauce, cause... WAGU, hello!  It did not need the cover up sauce.  I took off the onion rings and ate them separately. It was still a big, delicious burger with just the cheese and patty.  So juicy!  The black and blue burgers were also really, really good.\n\nWe also got the basket of fries and onion rings. The fries were good, but not anything special.  The onion rings were cut about 1\" width with a similar flavor to Texas Roadhouse's blooming onions.  Very good!\n\nI can't say I would recommend the giant pretzel.  I got it with Parmesan but not truffle flavor. It was REALLY salty, so I scrapped the salt off.  And the queso cheese was a bit too spicy for this  Midwest girl. (Although I've been in CO for 25 yrs).\n\nWith 3 burgers, fries/onion rings basket, giant pretzel and 3 soft drinks it was $88.00 This was my first time visiting 5280, was there grabbing lunch with my cousins. We were there late afternoon, so it wasn\u2019t too busy. There is something for everyone on the menu: burgers, wings, different sandwiches, salads, lots of apps and sides. 10/10 would recommend the queso fries, sooo tasty. They have a little ice cream shop attached to the side that can be accessed through the restaurant, my milkshake was delicious. Would recommend when you\u2019re craving a tasty, heavy burger or if you\u2019re looking for a quick bite. I will be coming back!"

    "reviews": "Literally just ordered here at this location, paid over 60 bucks plus a tip, and you're telling me this is food? This isn't even edible. Meat in tacos half undercooked, half burnt black somehow. Guacamole literally just hunks of unripe avocados that are like trying to eat hunks of plastic, rice tastes sour, tortillas are stale. Website is mysteriously \"down\" and won't allow me to submit feedback or request a refund, so I'll do it here! Give us a refund because this is disgusting and not ok. So the female there don't know what a \"surf-n-turf\" is. She started making my wife's bowl and when she tried to tell my wife what it was and ended up throwing it away even though my wife did not say she didn't want it. My wife told her that she didn't want the \"surf-n-turf\" but she was gonna keep the bowl and the female threw the bowl away anyways talking bout she can't let my wife keep it even though she ended up making the same damn thing. If I was the boss there, not gonna lie, I would've fired her on the spot. The young man there that finished helping us, he was kind so I give him 5 stars. Came here looking to get food, came out with a new awesome friend! Mayra was exceptionally kind and considerate and gave excellent customer service was very charismatic as well!! I am going to be coming here to this specific QDOBA from now on because of her! Thank you Mayra! Karen and team were amazing tonight!! They got our large order out in less than 10 minutes, all with no mistakes. I love this location, in large part, because of the staff.\nThanks again for the dinner assist!! Ordered online for a pick up went in to location and was not greeted so I proceeded to the counter where I said hi hello I have a pick and before I could even finish my sentence she just pointed to where the pick orders sat and let me say I was the only customer in the store. The girl was rude not professional and to top it off when we arrived home the bowls we ordered had near to nothing in them I got no beans when I ordered both and about less than a teaspoon of queso it looked pitiful for $15 and tasted old! Was so disappointed"

You got to sing! They got awesome singers and if you'd like to sing get there early This has by far been my fav karaoke spot for years. Their food isn't \"good - for bar food\", it's good for anywhere! Their tots are unbeatable, and I have a tough time choosing between their cheese steak or one of their grilled chicken sandwiches. It's a cozy, clean, and comfortable environment with an attentive staff and a friendly bunch of karaoke regulars. If you've been turned off by other karaoke experiences, this place might just turn you around! I absolutely love this karaoke bar, the vibe is great the way they have it set up is super easy to get up and sing karaoke more than once, the people they are awesome. The staff is great lunchboxes our favorite waiter and I even got to meet Santa. Connor and Eli were amazing. This was honestly the best service Ive had in a long time. Good vibes. We had margaritas during happy hour. Wings and fries. Food was delicious. Definitely recommend. We come here whenever we're in town. The karaoke, the people, the service, the food.. All of those are what we look forward to, and we've always had an amazing time."

    "reviews": "Ashley was an incredible server and made our experience, so great! The food was really good and the atmosphere was really nice too, it is so wonderful having a local Hooters that has great service and food at the same time! The food was horrible !\nthe bone in wings received the sauce for my boneless wings\nThe carrots were molded and when\nwe finally got our server she really didn\u2019t seem interested\nShe said she had the manager take off the vegetables hard to tell with the 150 dollar tab\nDefinitely won\u2019t be back!\nthe following morning I woke up so sick to my stomach it took hours before I felt better! This is a 17$ chicken sandwich\u2026..SEVENTEEN DOLLARS!! That\u2019s a pickle slice on half my sandwich. This is terrible, these things used to have chicken hanging off all sides of the bun and cost less. Make it make sense cause this is a rip off!! This is hardly even a kid size meal for a grown ass man!!! The service was great we got take out and it was really fast. That's why the food was terrible it tasted raw and it was gross. My son was so hungry he threw it in the air fryer at the hotel for awhile to finish cooking it because we hadn't gone grocery shopping yet. It put such a bad taste in my mouth I don't think I can ever eat at Hooters again. The sad thing is we just started eating at Hooters again.\nWe're from Florida and the Hooters Restaurants down there are all good. Food was awesome. Staff wasn't very mindful didn't get much service. They were friendly just wish we had more interaction."

    "reviews": "A month ago This location didn't used to charge for a tortilla on the side with a bowl. They apparently now do charge a dollar for the tortilla with a bowl. I recommend getting the chips instead. my boyfriend and I found this out when we went for dinner today. 5/25/25 Visited for the first time at this location in May 2025, staff understanding of how to assemble a quesadilla was good. But they cut it before it cooked and the end quarters were light on the chicken. I love this qdoba! I eat here several times a month and they always get my order perfect. My family and I come in and order out quite a bit, the staff is very friendly and it\u2019s usually pretty clean when we come in too. Definitely recommend this location! I'm a regular at this location.  They know me by name. The staff is so friendly and some have been there for a while.  Service and food is always great, but the friendliness is the best compliment I could give.  Great job!!  Thanks for all you do. It\u2019s always good food and I want to shout out to Felix he\u2019s very helpful and kind to everyone. I watched a kid tell him he ate all his food and he said good job I\u2019m proud of you little man. I feel like he takes his job to heart and I hope he keeps showing kindness"

    "reviews": "Stopped in here for a bite & a beer. Pretty cool place, very Colorado sports bar feel to it, like an independent Old Chicago. I sat at the bar & the service was good. Bartender was attentive. The wings were not very meaty at all and the bones were big, which wouldn't have been bad had there been meat. The Nashville Hot Chicken Sandwich was good, good heat and taste. Large beer selection\nIn all, not a bad place to stop for a quick bite and a good beer. PARRY THE PLATYPUS!? I mean pizzeria was good. Cool scenery, great service. I have to give it to the girl who served our pretty large table of nine. She did a lovely job. The food was yummy. The meat lovers pizza was meaty, the wings were winging, and the Mac was cheesy. Good selection of beer and plenty of good choices on the menu. It\u2019s got a laid back, sports bar feel. The pizza was solid, toppings seemed genuinely good quality. A bit on the expensive side all things considered. $7.50 coors light? We LOVE going to Parry's! The pizza tastes so fresh and the beer selection is pretty expansive. The best part of every visit is the service we get with Melissa. Sometimes we get a different server but if the wait is a little longer to be in her area,  we will gladly wait.  She is very knowledgeable about every beer which is important to us because we like to try different things. Even on busy nights,  she'll check in on us frequently and our glasses are never empty. In an industry where exceptional customer service is hard to find,  we know we can always count on a great experience with her. Highly recommend! Camry was awesome! She was super friendly, attentive, and made sure we had everything we needed. Even with the place being busy, she kept things running smoothly and always had a great attitude. Her service really made our visit special.\n\nAlso, the hostess was amazing\u2014so welcoming and friendly right from the start. It really set the tone for a great dining experience. Big thanks to the whole team at Party\u2019s Pizza!"

    "reviews": "I was pretty disappointed with this experience. The food was\u2026bland. The three of us all had burgers, and there was no seasoning on the meat. It was warm, not hot. The fries were cold. No refills offered on our waters. The service was alright; I think there may have been 2 servers for the entire restaurant, which may have explained why it was slow. The clincher was that I paid in cash and was not given coin back\u2014just bills. I know it was just 36 cents, but that adds up. No explanation\u2014just left the bills, thanked us, and walked away. If I could give them 10 stars I would. In town and wanted a good burger and I got the bet burger I have had in a very long time. The service was amazing and the price is very reasonable. It\u2019s been awhile since I been here! But burger was delicious as the last time I remembered! Fried pickles were on point also! Bad Daddy's was on the top of my list for awhile until a year or so ago. The food quality dropped in my local restaurant and I did not visit it as much. This location in Denver gave me Bad Daddy hope again. Well done! Or better yet Medium Rare! Note the 5 stars on service. The young lady at the bar was great. Pay her good, you need good people. Go eat here, it's worth it. I've been here several times, but not in the last year or 2. So we stopped in otw back home from a family event. I was in the mood for a GOOD burger. And they did NOT disappoint. The atmosphere is hip n chill. Good music playing. I got the mushroom burger with onion rings. It was perfect!!! Hubby got the Bistro burger with truffle fries. I stole some of his fries. Everything came out quickly, was hot and delicious. Absolutely recommend."

    "reviews": "I only recommend this place for dessert. Maybe drinks and appetizers. But the entrees have just seriously gone down hill. Hubby and I got the 4 cheese mac and cheese with honey pepper chicken tenders. The mac and cheese didn't taste like there was any cheese at all. The chicken was over cooked and none of it had much flavor. We poured Tabasco sauce over it to make it edible. Not sure what happened to the quality of food over the years but this was not worth $17 a plate?!?! Just ridiculous.\nFor dessert I had a butter pecan blonde which was delicious \ud83d\ude0b  and hubby had the cinnamon bites, also yummy and the best thing we ate there. Good food, good service. You can't beat that. We've been coming to this location for several years now. We like to pop in every once in a while to see what's new in the menu. This last visit was a real treat. We come here quite often. This last time was even better due to our server, Dean.  He was different than other servers we have had at other restaurants.  He would strike up a conversation and actually got to know us. The next time you go, ask to see if he is working and request him and yiu will know what I mean.\n\nOverall it was a nice visit.  We were seated right away which I didn\u2019t expect since it was a Friday evening. The service was good.  The food was good even through it did take a while to get it. We did the 2 for $23 (or something like that) deal. It's not Chili's but they stay open later than Chili's. Saturday night is mine and my husband's date night. We usually go out late and it's hard to find a place that's open that served food and alcohol past 11 or 12 pm around where we are staying in Westminster, Colorado. We discovered that Applebee's Grill+Bar was open late and decided to try it. We arrived a little too late a Chili's this week.\nWe were pleasantly surprised when our drinks and appetizers arrived. Again one of the best Dirty Martinis I've had again at another restaurant late in Westminster, Colorado. Who would of thunk it? Then our appetizers arrived and they were hot and freshly cooked. Not over done. We were once again impressed. It's rare to find a restaurant/bar that you can go to late at night and get good drinks and fresh hot appetizers that are cooked to perfection. I'm beginning to like Westminster better than Denver or Centennial.  Too bad we'll be leaving Colorado soon to travel but I'll be writing a lot more reviews from alot more different states. I flew in from out of state to celebrate a special moment with family. Didn\u2019t know much about the area and was looking for a late night eat as the family was starving from all the flying. Decided to go here, entered the establishment around 10:15PM and immediately the servers started looking at the eachother and putting their fingers on their noses as in they were deciding who was going to have to serve us a meal at their job\u2026 An older gentleman who was bald unhappily(from his body actions) walked towards us and offered us bar top seating when we had a child less than 21 years of age\u2026 we simply asked for a booth and just in his reactions and body language they didn\u2019t want us their(sighs, eye rolling,etc). We felt so unwelcome as first timers in Denver and to this location, we took our family and went out to look for another family style restaurant to have a meal at\u2026 even as we sat in our vehicle looking for another restaurant, we saw them laughing, pointing fingers, and nudging their heads towards our directions making a mockery of how we felt.\n\nSafe to say, it was the entire wait staff who treated us wrong just from us walking in the door. Didn\u2019t think I\u2019d ever have to enter an establishment and be treated in this manner during this day and age we live in"

    "reviews": "Rosie is absolutely amazing! The food is always good here but the service is really the stand out! We come here with large parties often and it\u2019s always a wonderful time with very speedy service! The menu is huge so some times it\u2019s really hard to choose what to get but I have never been disappointed in my choice! Food was fresh and good, with a staff that was attentive. The only down side was the wait. We arrived with a party of 6 plus a (sleeping) baby. While the hostess said they had a large enough table that had paid, they were still sitting there and the management would not move them on. This went on for nearly 40 minutes. During this time, many other folks came in and were seated - understandably as there were indeed free tables - but still the hostess refused to even gently nudge the folks at the needed table. I get it\u2019s a bit of a dilemma for the host, but there were ways to be obliging to both parties and encourage those that had finished and paid but still stay seated for another 45 minutes. We had lunch here today. We had the Burrito Gordo, which is basically a chile relleno burrito, as well as the lunch size Carne Asada plate. Also had a Michelada with Dos Equis. We also really enjoyed the cabage salsa. Everything tasted fresh and yummy. The server was very polite and prompt. Great experience! The food was really good, service was very nice.  Overall a nice atmosphere. The food is great, nice music overall, the only I wish if they would not put such a high volume of TV during the fight night.\nUnfortunately, the service is not the best, specifically we always get waitress who goes by name Alfredo, who is not always willing to help. I went with my family tonight, music was nice, but suddenly they cut off the music and TV sound went really for fight night and me and my family could not even talk with each other. I got up from my table, because I could not get any servers attention to reach to our tables. Finally I went to the cash register podium and spoke to Alfredo and asked him if the volume of TC could be lowered. Instead, he told me that I need to go see manager and asked him to reduce the volume. I found this inappropriate because he should call manager, not me reaching out to him. Also, I told Alfredo, that Margarita drink which we ordered we could not even drink due to high amount of alcohol in it, you could not even taste the Margarita drink, instead he replied oh well, I am just a server, I do not make drinks and took off. I was shocked of this behavior. I do not understand why he treats his clients this way, that\u2019s not right. Every time we come to this place, mostly he is the one serves us and we always leave unhappy. Last couple times we were served by other waiters and had much better experience. I really the owner of this place will fix this issue about waiter Alfredo, maybe give him more customer service training."

    "reviews": "I visited this store because it was the closest location to me. It was around 6 p.m., and there were about two people in the dining area. I ordered a JBC, a double stack, and a small drink. Food was actually cooked to order. What I found pleasantly surprised was that they have a fountain drink machine that offers multiple coke flavors. The dining room was clean, and the sun shone throughout the restaurant.  I enjoyed my meal while listening to soft rock music. I guess I was blessed to have a good experience based on all their previous reviews. I wasn't going to leave a bad review but the final straw was biting into a raw meat.  I ordered a meal, asked for no mayo and add mustard.  My fries were cold, so I got up asked for fresh fries.  They stuck my cold fries back in the fryer and gave me the same fries slightly toasted and hard.  I opened my burger.  It had mayo, no mustard, so I had to get up again.  I accidentally dropped the burger so I picked it all up and took it to the guy at the front who was glaring at me by now.  I'm not sure if I got a fresh burger or just a new bun.  Well, I got new fries that were fresh and hot, so they get one point.  The company that supplies their fries doesn't cut out any rotten parts of the potatoes, so it's nasty, you're having to eat around the rotten stuff on the fries.  That is the one thing I hate about Wendy's tasty fries.  I bit into my hamburger wondering if it was a new one or the old one I dropped.  I had to stop after 2 bites because it didn't taste right, and then I saw it, pink meat, raw meat!  Good grief!!  There was no manager handy, either. If I could do ZERO stars, I would!! We spent $32 on two fish combos, a kids meal, and an extra 4 piece nugget and the only thing that could be eaten was the chicken nuggets and drinks. The kids meal cheese burger was chili meat, (if you ever worked at a Wendy's, you know...), the fries were cold, and the two fish fillets were either so over cooked they were rocks, or they had been sitting in the bin for far longer than the hour allotted for \"fresh food\". The person that took our order was so stoned he couldn't even get through the order without asking us to repeat it multiple times. The employees were so lazy, they put two combos AND the kids meal all in the same bag. We tried calling the store and after 10-15 rings, they answered and hung up. The quality of this food and service are so far behind the Wendy's standard, I can't imagine what the management must be like. We do not live in the area and were traveling home so we're not able to just go back. Instead we went on our way hungry. Do better. And I really hope this reaches the district manager. Beyond unacceptable!!!! I stopped by in the middle of work to use the bathroom since it\u2019s a public restroom. And they force you to by some thing that is open to the public. How can I properly decide what I want if I even want anything while I\u2019m standing there trying not to piss my self! Food comes out way too fast. They are very obviously over cooking and hot holding when they dont need to. No reason I should be getting a chicken sandwich within 15 seconds of ordering at 2:30 on a weekday.\n\nThe chicken is always, always soft and honestly gross. It should never feel like reheated cold chicken from the grocery store but that's what I've gotten every time I try this place.\n\nThis is a pretty bad wendys, all they need to do is follow instructions on food prep and it would be much better."

The other favorite was the ravioli. Loved the taste.\nOverall, good location, perfect ambience, efficient service. This place is a must visit \ud83d\ude0a Fazoli\u2019s is normally a good place to eat. We went at 8 pm and honestly thought it was closed because the lights outside were all off but people were inside.\n\nWhen we ordered we let them know the lights were out and the girl just shrugged her shoulders.\n\nMost of the dinning room pasted the pop machines was closed off and 4 tables in the area available had dirty plates on them so not keeping up with the dinning room.\n\nThe noodles were clumped together and very little sauce. Not enjoyable. Bread sticks were not fresh.\n\nThe parking lot had a lot of trash in it but maybe they could not see it because the lights were off. Good thing no one tripped and fell in the dark.\n\nThis location has really gone downhill. The food was fantastic! Every dish was fresh, flavorful, and clearly made with love. You can tell the team puts real heart into the menu and service. The kids were happy, the adults were happy\u2014what more could you ask for? I was given food vouchers to try Fazoli's again.  Please read my review at the Austin Bluffs location in Colorado Springs.\n\nNow on to this Fazoli's.  I was extremely pleased with my visit here in Thornton, Colorado.  My order was taken promptly and accurately.  Me and my son got hot appetizers, meals and bread sticks.  We were checked on and given more hot bread sticks.  I was a little bumped by having to get my own silverware but not a deal breaker.\n\nI gave a lower atmosphere score because the dine in section was dark, and older looking.  It could use some color, brighter lights and be a little more open.\n\nAll in all my experience was awesome.  Shout out to Chris and all his crew for doing an amazing job.  I will definitely be back to this location and other locations across Colorado.  Thank you for the great food!  Me and my son enjoyed everything we were given. My mom and I went for lunch on 5/16/25 and I also ordered food to go for my sister, after we had finished our lunch. Rikki helped us the entire time we were there. She was so nice and helpful. Rikki even checked in on us a few times during our meal, as well. We typically have a good experience here, but this was by far our best experience that we've had at this Fazoli's."

They were efficient, paid attention to detail, and managed orders quickly and accurately which made our visit seamless. They both displayed a warm demeanor and genuine care for customers. It created an inviting and memorable experience. Their teamwork and professionalism set them apart, even during busy times, and their dedication to excellence reflects positively on the brand. They are the kind of employees who keep customers coming back, and their hard work truly deserves recognition through a pay raise or other acknowledgment. We will definitely be coming back. Delicious! \ud83d\ude0a\n\n- Porsche & Shjon (just two people who had the perfect post gym meal because of Brian & Nancy) A new chain for me. Its a Chipotle style choose your own with food in stages. Its good and the portuons are generous. Def had a good time. Pretty disappointed we did catering for 30 people, the cost was north of $600 ( includes food, tax, tip,  etc) at best it was enough food for 16 people. I understand some people eat more. Some people eat less, but we literally didn't even have enough to feed half of our family.\n\nWhen we spoke with the store manager, we were told, not sure. You'll have to speak with the GM ?\n\nTerrible customer service an execution. We had a newborn baby so yes we use DoorDash a lot and our go to is always Qdoba however this location can never get anything right with our order either things are missing, toppings in bowls that we didn\u2019t order added in our food, or today they put a receipt on outside of the bag with my name but everything inside has another persons name on it. So non of this is doordashers fault. It\u2019s purely just poor work ethic. Please fix staffing and managements skills. Disappointed. Ordered a steak bowl. It came with something extra in it. I don't remember asking for Plastic. Makes you lose your appetite after chewing on something like that. Also ordered a chicken bowl with guacamole. The guacamole rolled out of that bowl, and the staff member just wiped off the serving counter and never replaced it with another scoop. Flavor was lacking in taste. Must have changed the seasonings."

The big boy burrito didn\u2019t have any flavor. Was bland and the hash browns were soggy. The other breakfast burrito was better. The green chile makes a huge difference but not everyone wants smothered burrito. The pancakes were yummy and the liver was fantastic. Fresh and cooked to perfection. The strawberry shortcake French toast was just pan fried cake with topping. Did not taste like it was dipped in any egg. So the cake was a little dry but the strawberries and whipped cream saved it. All of it was eaten haha. overall it\u2019s a diner. We enjoyed our breakfast I love a diner that has breakfast all day and this place has a ton of amazing options! The strawberry shortcake French toast was delicious! Also, the chocolate shake was nice and creamy and made with real ice cream \ud83d\udc9a We went here on Christmas day and everything was wonderful. I got the \u201chungry man breakfast\u201d and it was a great choice. The food came fast and was delicious. The service was on point. The Xmas decor was lovely. Would recommend!! So I only reluctantly give this review. When I find a true gem, I am loathe to share it...but they were truly wonderful, so I don't have a choice.\n\nDon't let the exterior fool you. It opens up like the Tardis, and transports you back in time. The 50's decor is just enough to set a mood for ...a diner. A real one.\nBreakfast all day? Check.\nHandmade shakes? Check.\n\nAnd oh the food.\nThey probably signed a deal with Satan for their coleslaw recipe. (I have had it all over the country. 5 stars!)\n\nI ordered meatloaf, being in a beefy mood. Delicious. And a decent portion too,\nServed with perfect mashed potatoes and honest to goodness gravy.\n(Brown and fabulous)\n\nDid I mention the perfect size to share waffle fries?\nFlawless. Fried to perfection with a touch of crunch, served with ranch, but really GOOD ranch.\n\nOur server was the lovely Esme. Yes, she's a waitress but she's also a maternal treasure. If you get her, please tip her well. She is a doll!\n\nMy daughter had\nthe popcorn shrimp, which was also delightful.\n\nThe only flaw?\nWe were so full from lunch, we didn't get a chance to try the funnel cake fries. (Whine!)\n\nThey do it well, and I will be back! Thank you for reminding me how awesome a true Diner can be!\ud83c\udf08 Classic diner with friendly service and delicious food. Order a burger and the patty melt with onion rings. Everything was fresh and flavorful. The vibe is fun and service is great. Can\u2019t wait to come back to try breakfast!"

    "reviews": "The place is clean, atmosphere is great (younger crowd) but food wasn\u2019t the best and there was a lady bartender who was very rude. We wanted to order food and she was giving us an attitude because we were trying to figure out what we wanted. There were two other super sweet and pretty(completing them way) white and an African girl that were amazing! They were super attentive and a definition of what a server/bartender should be like. Space felt a little tight but we found a nice table by the wall and kept away from crowd. I would definitely be back. Some photos were taken before it got busy. Went in late Sunday night for a drink. Walking in noticed th bartender seeing us as she was talking to customers. Stood at the bar for about five minutes as she carried on her conversation with zero recognition. This is way out of the norm with the other bartenders that normally work Sundays. Expecting Erica who gives amazing service, is very prompt with all her Customers and communicates. Kevin and Erin are always outstanding as well. These are the people that need to be training unqualified staff. I hope this location finds consistency soon. I come to this bar fairly regularly I usually spend $50-$80 depending if I have friends tag along today I had my friends and myself and we only spent 20 considering that our server Maria never came up to check on our table after bringing us our 1 round of shots and our singular drink which we had to get from the bar because she forgot to bring it to us ended up, ordering some food at the bar because she never came up to check on us, and I had to go get my own food because we just saw it sitting there even tho we saw the server next to the kitchen window talking to the bar back. God bless the bartender, though he was really attentive and even though he looked like he was slammed he was getting to everyone fairly quickly and ended up taking care of use considering we couldn\u2019t close out with her because she kept walking past even when we tried to get her attention Bar the also has a virtual golf sim.  Pretty mediocre food that was overpriced (fast food is better imo).  Golf sim was very buggy, but cheap and an overall fun time with friends!  I\u2019d come here and avoid the food again if I had to.\n\nFood unfortunately is not as good as fast food options in the area, so I\u2019d probably encourage to go somewhere else.  It was bad, but for the price, it\u2019s worth to go to a fast food joint.\n\nDo not get the sliders - terrible terrible value.\n\nThe bar itself was probably the coolest part.  Pretty divey, but the vibe was great in there.\n\nGolf sim was $30-hour?  Okay, but I\u2019d rather go to top golf unless I\u2019m trying to save on drinks We had such a wonderful experience here for  Kareokee!!

    "reviews": "Nice cozy bar area with low lighting and a relaxing atmosphere. A much larger room in the back had higher ceilings and more seating with views of their brewing vats. Visited here a couple of times while staying in the area and enjoyed both times. Service was friendly and the beer selection had something for everyone. In town for our son's graduation at CU Boulder. Drove up from Texas, and everyone was in the mood for a drink when we got here. Satire just happened to be right next door, and I'm so glad it was! The names of the food and drinks were hilarious, and everything was delicious. Can't wait to stop by again! I recently visited Satire Brewing Company for the first time. I was impressed with the very good service and the extra yummy beer. I will definitely be going back again and again. This place is designed for adults and is a great place to hang out. Great local craft brews. Family owned and friendly spot. Cozy tasting room and bar  with nice music for good conversation, outdoor patio with gorgeous flowers, and back room with screens for game day.\nWhiskey distillery next door too with great local made whiskey drinks. This place has it all. My favorite area brewery! Satire is a really cool place with great ambiance and some seriously unique beers. I have not seen or tried so many fascinating drinks in a long while. I HIGHLY recommend getting the flight and trying everything! Good service, too!"
